        "title": "A singer's death, 38,000 songs and a question - who owns the music?",
        "content": "Vishal Kalita's collection of music cassettes has turned his residence in India's Assam state into a private museum. For more than a decade, the 30-year-old has been travelling across the country buying obsolete tapes, which he has carefully stored at his home in Guwahati city. The collection, which was opened to the public last month, also includes hundreds of CDs and rare posters of musicians from around the world. But it's the discography of Zubeen Garg, a singer and composer from the state, that has been drawing the most number of visitors. A cultural icon in Assam, Garg died in Singapore last month, leaving his millions of fans heartbroken. Mr Kalita has some 38,000 songs of the singer in his collection, including songs that cannot be found anywhere else today, he says. On 16 September, just days before his death, Garg had even visited Mr Kalita's residence and said the collection reminded him of some of his \"long-forgotten\" creations. Mr Kalita is now part of a larger network of Garg's fans and friends who are trying to make his oeuvre more accessible through online streaming platforms and ensure royalties for his family. \"Some of these cassettes are too old and can get damaged. I want to bring them back to public memory,\" he says. Many of Garg's songs cannot be uploaded online without risking copyright violation owing to a lack of clarity over their ownership, which is scattered among a complicated network of producers, distributors and music labels. It's not just him - music ownership is a long-debated subject globally. For instance, 14-time Grammy winner Taylor Swift had to re-record her albums to own all her music , while several other musicians have started their own labels to retain full or partial control over their work. In India, too, music ownership has long been mired in tensions around contracts tilted in favour of producers and labels over creators. \"There are hundreds of his songs whose ownership is either difficult to trace or remains contested,\" Manas Barua, filmmaker and Garg's friend, told the BBC. In India, the Copyright Act, 1957, governs music ownership, with separate copyright for lyrics, musical composition and sound recording, says Delhi-based intellectual property rights lawyer Neel Mason. The \"first owners\" of the lyrics and musical composition are the \"authors\" - the lyricists and composers, respectively. But when it comes to the sound recordings, \"the producer is deemed to be the author\", so they are the first owner, says Mr Mason. Owners can transfer ownership or choose to grant rights to third parties, exclusively or non-exclusively, through licensing, which can lead to a complex and often untraceable network unless paperwork is meticulously maintained. In a career spanning 33 years, 52-year-old Garg sang in more than 40 languages and dialects. Some of his songs are owned by his own label, while many from the 1990s and 2000s belong to producers and distributors that pay him royalties. The producers transferred the copyright to distributors, says Mr Barua. \"For decades, such copyright transfers were done without charging money. There was no way for producers to monetise music other than through cassettes and CDs. So, they were dependent on distributors.\" New economic prospects around music ownership opened up only after private radio stations started acquiring licences from music owners for hefty amounts, and grew manifold with online streaming. The music licensing ecosystem in India has evolved over the years, with focus moving from royalties to ownership, says music journalist Anurag Tagat. \"The online streaming revolution has highlighted the importance of ownership and the economic opportunities that can emerge in the future.\" In Garg's case, several songs have uncertain or contested ownership, and some of them can be found online, uploaded by random users only to be repeatedly removed. Also, many of Garg's older tracks were never digitised and risk being lost. Shyamantak Gautam, a producer of Assamese films and an associate of Garg, has engaged a team to draft a list of songs written, sung and composed by Garg. IPRS - India's sole government-authorised organisation that collects and distributes music royalties - says it is ensuring that creators or their families are paid when their work is used commercially. This is a great initiative, and it should have been done years ago, popular Bollywood singer Shaan told the BBC. \"Tracking distributors at a regional level to fix music ownership can be a challenging prospect. But if they can do it as a team, that's great.\" The producers of Garg's songs were all from Assam, so it was not difficult to identify them, says Mr Gautam, adding that the challenge begins after that. Mr Barua says, \"We are building a chain to determine how licences changed hands among distributors. In his Garg's case, several distributors who last held a licence or owned his songs are either dead or have wound up their business.\" Garg's case is a window to the massive oeuvres of several Indian singers and issues of ownership right and compensation associated with them. For instance, SP Balasubrahmanyam , who sang more than 40,000 songs, got into a legal dispute with legendary composer Ilaiyaraaja. Lata Mangeshkar , who lent her voice to more than 30,000 melodies, was a vocal advocate of artists' royalties - an issue over which she fell out with producers and fellow artists in the industry. Decades before Garg and several of his contemporaries in India started their music labels, legendary Indian singer KJ Yesudas did so in 1980. The central idea was the same: to have more control over their creations. Meanwhile, in Guwahati, Mr Kalita is trying to get access to the latest Japanese technology to digitise some of Garg's tapes that can't be found online. \"I want these rare tapes to be digitised in the best quality. Zubeen Garg will live through his music. And, as his fan, that's the least I can do for him,\" he says.",

        "title": "Home Office squandered billions on asylum hotels, MPs say",
        "content": "The Home Office has \"squandered\" billions of pounds of taxpayers' money on asylum accommodation, according to a report by a committee of MPs. The Home Affairs Committee said \"flawed contracts\" and \"incompetent delivery\" left the department unable to cope with a surge in demand and it relied on hotels as \"go-to solutions\" instead of temporary stop-gaps. The MPs said expected costs had tripled to more than 15bn and not enough had been done to recoup excess profits. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"determined\" to close all asylum hotels adding: \"I can't tell you how frustrated and angry I am that we've been left with a mess as big as this by the last government.\" The prime minister said the Home Office was processing asylum claims \"much more quickly\" and removing those with no right to be in the country \"at a higher rate than the best part of a decade\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said \"mistakes had been made\" under the previous Tory government but added that Labour's decision to scrap the Rwanda scheme - aimed at deterring asylum seekers from coming to the UK in small boats - had exacerbated the problem. Just under 103,000 asylum seekers are being housed by the government, of which just over 32,000, around a third, are accommodated in 210 hotels. Asylum accommodation is currently delivered through a series of large-scale, regional contracts agreed by the previous government with a number of private providers, which started in 2019 and will expire in 2029. They allow for the use of \"contingency accommodation\" - usually hotels - when demand exceeds supply, but state that these should only be used on a short-term basis. The report said the current system for housing people seeking asylum - with its reliance on hotels - was expensive, unpopular with local communities and unsuitable for the asylum seekers themselves. The report said the contracts drawn up for accommodation providers under the Conservatives had been flawed and that \"inadequate oversight\" had meant failings went \"unnoticed and unaddressed\". Expected costs for hotel contracts from 2019-2029 have risen from 4.5bn to 15.3bn, while two accommodation providers still owe millions in excess profits that the Home Office has not recovered, the report found. The report said the department neglected its day-to-day management of the contracts, and had not sufficiently ordered financial penalties for providers who have poor performance. This includes no fines for failures at hotels and the larger accommodation sites, while excess profits from providers are yet to be reclaimed. The committee said the money should be used on public services, \"not sitting in the bank accounts of private businesses\". There are few issues more sensitive for this government than its management of the asylum system. While ministers have set a deadline for ending the use of asylum hotels by the next general election, most likely 2029, they want to show progress in reducing the numbers long before then. Labour officials are especially anxious about how hotels can become a rallying point for frustration in different communities across the country. The specific criticism of the Home Office is also the latest reminder of how many government controversies emanate from that department, following rows only in the last week over the grooming gangs inquiry, the collapse of the prosecution of two men accused of spying for China, and the return of a migrant deported to France under the 'one in one out' scheme. External factors, including the pandemic and the \"dramatic\" increase in small boat arrivals, have meant the Home Office has had to accommodate \"a growing number of people for longer periods of time\" the MPs' report said. Choices made by the previous Conservative government, including to delay asylum decisions as it pursued the scheme to deport migrants to Rwanda, factored into this, MPs added. While the report acknowledged the \"challenging environment\" in which the Home Office was operating, it said \"its chaotic response has demonstrated that it has not been up to the challenge\". Chair of the committee Dame Karen Bradley told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We just ended up with more people than the contracts ever thought there could be and that's meant that the costs have absolutely rocketed.\" \"The government has only just started looking at claiming back those profits, auditing the accounts to see what is due back to the taxpayer,\" Dame Karen said. The said \"failures of leadership at a senior level\" were among reasons the Home Office was \"incapable of getting a grip on the situation\". Dame Karen said the department had \"neglected the day-to-day management of these contracts\" and has focused on \"short term, reactive responses\". \"The skills needed to manage these contracts simply were not present in the Home Office when they were drawn up,\" she added. Housing Secretary Steve Reed accused the previous government of \"pouring taxpayers' money down the drain\". He added that Labour ministers were continuing to look at housing asylum seekers on disused military bases, with an announcement \"within weeks\". He added that while the government was also looking at longer-term rental accommodation options, military sites represented the \"least expensive option available\" to house asylum seekers. Two former military sites - MDP Wethersfield, a former RAF base in Essex, and Napier Barracks, a former military base in Kent - are already being used to house asylum seekers after being opened under the Conservatives. Dame Karen welcomed the government's pledge to shift away from asylum hotels and invest in larger sites like military bases. But she said past failings, like moving people into accommodation too quickly, must not be repeated. In response to the report, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"We have already taken action - closing hotels, slashing asylum costs by nearly 1bn and exploring the use of military bases and disused properties.\" Several protests and counter-protests over asylum hotels have taken place across the UK this year, notably in Epping over the summer after an asylum seeker being housed at The Bell Hotel was charged with two sexual assaults. Asked whether the Conservatives should accept some of the responsibility for the contracts, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"Well yes. \"I'm not saying that everything we did was perfect, but one of the things Labour should not have done was scrap the Rwanda scheme. \"Scrapping that scheme removed the deterrence, and meant that small boat crossings increased by 40.\"",

        "content": "Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr says he \"didn't want to offend anyone\" when he and some of his team-mates clashed with Barcelona players after winning Sunday's El Clasico. The Brazil forward, 25, expressed his frustration at being substituted in the 72nd minute and went straight down the tunnel. He returned to the Real bench later and, after his side's 2-1 win, tried to confront Barcelona's 18-year-old winger Lamine Yamal during unsavoury post-match scenes. Vinicius was one of five players booked for their part in the incident, while Real's substitute goalkeeper Andriy Lunin was shown a red card. \"El Clasico is like that,\" Vinicius told Real Madrid TV. \"There are a lot of things happening on and off the pitch. \"We try to maintain a balance, but it's not always possible. We didn't want to offend anyone, not Barca players, nor the fans. \"We know that when we step on to the pitch, we have to defend our side, and that's how it was today.\" Lamine Yamal had angered the Real players by saying last week that Real 'steal' and 'complain'. After scoring Sunday's winner at the Bernabeu, Real's England midfielder Jude Bellingham said on Instagram: , external \"Talk is cheap. Hala Madrid always.\" There have been many reports in recent months that Los Blancos would consider letting Vinicius leave if they received a suitable offer. At the end of this season, the Fifa Best men's player of the year will have one year remaining on his contract but talks over a new deal have stalled. When Vinicius was substituted on Sunday, cameras from broadcaster Dazn picked up the Brazilian saying: \"Always me! I'm leaving the team! It's better if I leave, I'm leaving.\" Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso responded by saying: \"I focus on a lot of positive things in the game, and positive things from Vini. We'll talk about his reaction, of course.\" On the clashes after the final whistle, Alonso said: \"I interpret it with normality. We don't have to make too much of it. \"It's the tension of the moment, for them and us. These scuffles have always happened.\" Meanwhile, Real Madrid captain Dani Carvajal will have surgery on his right knee and might be out for the rest of the year. The 33-year-old Spaniard has made seven appearances in 10 La Liga games this season, coming on as a second-half substitute during El Clasico. His latest injury setback comes a year after he ruptured two ligaments and a tendon in the same knee, ruling him out for much of last season. \"Following tests carried out on our captain Dani Carvajal by Real Madrid's medical services, he has been diagnosed with a loose body in his right knee. Carvajal will undergo arthroscopic surgery,\" Real said on Monday.",

        "title": "Why one small town with very little immigration turned to Reform UK",
        "content": "Here in the heart of the Peak District, there is one main issue on people's minds: everyone in the laid-back spa town of Buxton, it seems, has a view on plans for a 100m redevelopment of the town centre. As part of the redevelopment, the River Wye, currently running narrow and shallow through the centre of town, is to be widened. When the plans were posted on one Facebook group, the first comment underneath read: \"Open up the river, yeah so the dinghies can head straight to the hotel!\" Immigration, perhaps, is the second biggest issue on people's minds - even though there are very few immigrants in this Derbyshire town of 20,000 people, known for its opera house and grand Georgian crescent. It was such concerns that helped Reform UK win control of Derbyshire County Council in May. The rise of Reform UK in the opinion polls, and the fact immigration is now the top concern for voters across the country according to YouGov, is not seen only in the places with most immigration. It is apparent even in small towns like Buxton, that has very little. In May, Reform UK won in one Buxton county council ward and came a close second to the Conservatives in the other. It is 250 miles from here to Dover, where the small boats arrive, and there are no hotels in Buxton housing asylum seekers. In fact, the latest government figures show that in June, of the nearly 103,000 asylum seekers being accommodated across the UK, none of them lived in High Peak Borough Council, the area that covers Buxton. Yet six months ago, in the county council elections in Buxton, almost a third of those who voted backed Reform UK. \"I do see faces that I haven't seen before,\" says Robert Stordy, standing by the town's market on a Tuesday lunchtime, although he admits he does not know where those new faces are from. The 74-year-old describes himself as disillusioned by recent governments, both Conservative and Labour. He believes most of the young men arriving on boats are here to work, not fleeing oppression. \"They're using our facilities. This country is strapped for cash - the NHS is all over the place, it's suffering greatly. It puts pressure on local doctors, local services.\" What is clear in Buxton is the chasm in opinion on immigration between the town's young and old, a sentiment Ian Howarth, who runs the Queen's Head Hotel, hears regularly. Buxton's population is older than the England average. Describing the town as \"a large village really\", Mr Howarth, whose sister is a Tory MP, spends his days leading the charge over car parking spaces linked to the town redevelopment and lending an ear to vociferous discussions about immigration. \"It's a generational thing,\" he says. \"The younger crowd are very much against it Reform UK while the older crowd are very much for them.\" Indeed, an hour with some sixth formers at Buxton Community School brings home his point. The overwhelming sentiment of the 10 teenagers is that immigrants are being scapegoated. \"I think there's a lot of prejudice in this country about people who aren't white,\" says Henry. \"If the people coming over on the boats were rich and white, it would be completely different.\" Another pupil, Elliott, feels that asylum seekers \"are doing it because they've no other choice. Their only hope is to get away from the horrible things happening where they've come from and we're treating them like they're not welcome.\" The teenagers don't yet have a vote though, and in May's local elections, those who turned out gave Reform UK a sweeping victory - the party winning 42 of Derbyshire's County Council's 64 seats. The party also gained control of nine other councils across England. Among the new Reform UK councillors is Melandra Smith, who won one of the two Buxton seats. A fluent Japanese speaker, she was known as a local campaigner before she became involved in party politics. She pushed for Buxton to have a town council and for repairs to its many potholes - as Britain's highest market town, the weather often leaves its mark. She was also heavily involved in a campaign to stop the University of Derby turning its now empty 274-room hall of residence in the town into dispersal accommodation for asylum seekers. The plan, announced in 2023, was opposed by thousands of people in Buxton and dropped by the university in 2024. It was \"a wake-up call for the town\", she says. The mother of two acknowledges her local profile helped her electorally, but says that, increasingly, people are contacting her about illegal immigration. \"The university halls are still not being used for anything and there are other large buildings in Buxton that are not currently in use and people worry, 'Will they turn it into one of these dispersal centres?' I get a lot of questions about this. Sometimes it's a little bit irrational, too much of a worry.\" Those ongoing fears, she feels, are, however, a consequence of government policies \"because there doesn't seem to be any thoughtful plan nationally to deal with the people coming in illegally\". On Spring Gardens, Buxton's main shopping street, people hark back to a bygone age. At first glance, the High Street appears to be holding up well in comparison with many towns. A steady stream of tourists means there are a raft of coffee shops and bakeries and few empty premises. However, \"there's nothing we actually need\", says Yvonne, 50, looking around at the local shopfronts. \"If you need to buy children's clothes and shoes, there's nothing.\" Her disappointment at what is happening locally is exacerbated by the national picture. \"I haven't got faith in anything anymore - there is nobody out there that is offering me any hope. They tell you one thing and do something else, so it doesn't matter who you decide to vote for.\" That sentiment of powerlessness, hopelessness even, permeates many conversations. Older people do not want illegal immigrants in their town, in their country, but feel they cannot stop them. And they feel similarly impotent over what they do want - a bustling High Street, a new medical centre. Plans for a 20m health hub for Buxton, for instance, failed to get government funding in 2023, leaving the proposed site derelict and unsightly. There have been some immigrants who have come to Buxton. In 2022, about 150 Ukrainians moved to the town and people \"opened their houses, their hearts to us\", says Natalia. About 100 or so are still here, she says, sitting alongside two friends - Paulina and Yulia - on a bench in the centre of town. Most have moved into their own accommodation and found jobs, a lot in hospitality and cleaning. \"We don't feel like immigrants because we lived with British families and we are very closely connected with these families,\" says Natalia. \"I feel a part of society because I did not get any negative emotion from British people.\" Also on Spring Gardens, Liam McGuinness says he does not have a problem with the Ukrainians or indeed \"against families coming in that need help. It's more single men\". He brings up the University of Derby's abandoned proposals. \"I wasn't happy at the thought of maybe having 300 single blokes down here. They might be able to melt away in a big city, but if you've got them in the size of Buxton, it's a different matter.\" The 68-year-old, originally from County Armagh, says he would support the idea of housing asylum seekers in army camps - as well as allowing them to work, perhaps helping farmers or others in need of labour, to offset the cost of their accommodation. \"I would think the majority would want to work but the law does not allow them to work. Then they're going to sit around the towns and parks, which is obviously causing people problems.\" Supporters of immigration often point to the benefits that immigrants bring, particularly to the NHS. But in Buxton, that is not so obvious, particularly as there is no major local hospital. The town, encircled by the Peak District, is about an hour from the nearest cities - Derby, Manchester, Sheffield and Stoke - and statistics show that Derbyshire social care and NHS workforce is significantly less diverse than the national average. Without any distinct benefits locally, perception of the national picture dominates residents' opinions. \"We've got enough people living on the streets that we need to look after ourselves,\" says Gail Hartington, 69, sitting by some late-blooming plants close to Miltons Tap bar. \"They're coming over and getting money from the government; we need to concentrate on our own first.\" In 2024, the Sunday Times named Buxton as one of the best places to live in the UK, describing it as a \"cultural powerhouse\", highlighting both the opera house and annual international festival. The town's new development proposals also describe it as a \"sleeping giant\". But those garlands do not impress the town's youngsters. A couple of the teenagers at the school actually want to leave Britain, never mind Buxton, so furious are they with the state of the country. One young man says he regularly argues with his grandmother and father over the small boat arrivals as \"both say as soon as they set foot in Dover, they should just be put on a boat and sent straight back\". The sense that Buxton's best days - Britain's best days, even - lay behind it has permeated the minds of these teenagers, too. Few feel optimistic, with worries about student debts, jobs and affordable housing being mentioned as well as the general state of the nation. One young woman does stand out, however. Asked what made her feel hopeful, Jodie says it is mainly because \"things can't really get much worse, to be honest\".",

        "title": "'Without 2002-03 there was no chance of 2005'",
        "content": "England's captain and a longed-for Ashes triumph in the greatest series of them all. Before Vaughan's life-changing moment, when he lifted the urn at The Oval, came a first brush with the Australians almost three years earlier. England were steamrollered 4-1 down under in 2002-03 by arguably the best Test team of all time. Captain Steve Waugh, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and the rest. But Vaughan - on his only tour of Australia - bloodied some noses and learned valuable lessons about how to beat the men in baggy green caps. Three hundreds, and a total of 633 runs bettered in this century by only two other visiting batters in Australia - Alastair Cook and Virat Kohli. For a while, Vaughan was rated as the best batter in the world and, more importantly, was on the road to the England captaincy. Twenty years on from the series that defined his career, he says there was \"no chance\" of victory in 2005 without the experience of 2002-03. \"Once I got the captaincy, I thought 'what do I do?'\" Vaughan tells BBC Sport. \"I looked back on the people I'd been captained by and the captains I'd played against. Steve Waugh was the standout. His manner, his mechanisms. \"In county cricket, teams would bowl part-time bowlers before lunch to get through the overs. Every time I watched Steve Waugh, the over before lunch he'd turn to someone like Brett Lee and say :'Bowl bouncers round the wicket.' He'd make those periods the hardest. \"Little things like walking on the field. I'd walk on to the field and say hello to everyone. If you said hello to Steve Waugh, he'd just look at you and make you feel about three feet tall. He intimidated with field settings, small words. Not abuse. It helps when you've got an attack of Warne, McGrath, Lee and Jason Gillespie but he did not get the credit for his tactical nous.\" Vaughan impressed in the early part of his England career without standing out: 16 Tests, one hundred at an average of 31.15. In 2002, Vaughan tweaked his technique because dismissals to deliveries that nipped back to the right-hander were \"doing my nut in\". With an earlier trigger movement, Vaughan plundered 900 runs in seven home Tests against Sri Lanka and India. Only two men - Graham Gooch and Donald Bradman - have scored more in an English Test summer. Vaughan arrived down under with the benefit of form and advice from India great Sachin Tendulkar, who suggested attacking McGrath at every opportunity. Neither prepared Vaughan for the scrutiny of an overseas Ashes tour. \"We arrived in Perth and did a gentle fielding session at the Waca, and it went great,\" says Vaughan. \"The local newspaper positioned a camera. When you field for an hour and a half, and there's 16 or 17 in the squad, there's bound to be one or two go down. \"Next day on the front of the paper was 'England drop in to town' and pictures of us all dropping a ball.\" The 2002-03 series was the last 'old-school' England tour of Australia. England played their first game on 22 October and their last more than three months later. The Ashes paused after three Tests for one-day internationals. The tourists played four warm-up matches before the first Test, with Vaughan's good form continuing with a century against Queensland. It did little to help him on the first morning of the first Test in Brisbane. \"It was a horrible feeling. Gut-wrenching,\" he says. \"As much as you're desperate, excited and you've had the dreams of playing in an Ashes series, when it came I just thought, 'this is awful'. \"The pressure, the anthems. Walking out to sing at the Gabba - little things like that. I probably hid them nicely, put on a decent act that I was cool and calm, but I hated that first week.\" In a Test remembered for captain Nasser Hussain's infamous decision to field first, England were flattened by 384 runs. Simon Jones was carried off on a stretcher after a sickening knee injury and other plans fell at the first hurdle. \"We'd had the talk about 'we're as one, when we go to the Aussies, we go together',\" says Vaughan. \"Andrew Caddick gave Matthew Hayden a few choice words early. Hayden drop-kicked Caddick over his head for six. Caddick went at him again and no-one else said a word.\" Vaughan made scores of 33 and nought, with no real hint of the glut of runs to come. On the morning of the second Test in Adelaide, he was a severe doubt with a knee injury that would dog the rest of his career. When Hussain went to toss up, this time choosing to bat first, Vaughan was still in the nets making sure he was fit enough to play. He hobbled to 19, then came a sliding-doors moment. A drive at a wide one from Andy Bichel was taken by Justin Langer diving forward from point. Langer claimed what appeared to be a clean catch, but Vaughan was unmoved. Standing umpire Steve Bucknor called for TV umpire Steve Davis, all while former Australia captain Mark Taylor - commentating on television - became gradually more agitated. Somehow, Vaughan got away with it. \"He caught it, but I knew I had a chance,\" says Vaughan. \"It was close to the ground. On TV it was always going to look like it touched one blade of grass and that's enough. \"The longer the review goes on, the more you think you're getting away with it. I was laughing to myself, because I knew what was coming. I knew I'd be absolutely lambasted. The Australians murdered me. All of them. Langer took it all day.\" Vaughan made 177 - his first Ashes hundred and first against anyone outside of England. To go with a dodgy knee, the Yorkshireman had his shoulder bone chipped by a Gillespie bouncer. \"All the Aussies came to shake my hand in the dressing room, apart from Justin,\" says Vaughan. \"The confidence of scoring a hundred against Australia in Australia, it doesn't get much better. Of all the hundreds I got in my career, that was the most special.\" Despite Vaughan's effort, England were beaten by an innings, just as they were in the third Test in Perth, meaning the Ashes were lost on 1 December. There were still almost two months of the tour remaining. England could have suffered another innings defeat in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, following on 281 behind, but Vaughan was at it again. His 145 set Australia a target of 107. The home side were 58-3 and 83-4 before finally winning by five wickets. \"The MCG was being renovated,\" says Vaughan. \"I remember scoring a hundred, looking around to wave my bat and just saw a load of builders. I waved my bat to them. \"We could have won that game. We needed another 60 or 70 runs. Australia were jittery.\" As strange as it sounds for a team 4-0 down, England were improving. \"We were starting to play better cricket,\" says Vaughan. \"It takes two or three games to realise you are up against human beings. \"You start by looking at them like they are robots or aliens - just too good. I understood they were quality, but if you did the basics really well you had a chance.\" In Sydney, England were battling to avoid being humbled 5-0. With only one run between the teams after the first innings, Vaughan struck again. A sparkling 183 set Australia 452 to win and Caddick, with 10 wickets in the match, did the rest. England celebrated like they won the Ashes, not a dead rubber, and Vaughan banked another Ashes lesson. \"I remember sitting in the dressing room and thinking ',you've just got to do that three times to win the Ashes',\" he says. \"No-one spoke, but I thought any team can be got if you play good cricket. \"I wasn't thinking as a leader at that time, but getting the captaincy later that year, I know I learned so much from that series.\" More was taken from post-series beers with the Australia team - interactions discouraged by Hussain while the Ashes were still being contested. \"Sitting in the dressing room with the Aussies was great,\" says Vaughan. \"Nasser made it very clear he didn't want us to socialise with Australia. The best way to find out about them is to get to know them. You generally find out they are just normal people that play cricket very, very well. We had great fun in the dressing room.\" Six months later, Vaughan replaced Hussain as Test captain. His mission was to reshape an England team scarred by years of Ashes beatings. Only four of the XI from Sydney made it to the first Ashes Test at Lord's in 2005. \"It wasn't two years of waking up and thinking, 'we've got to beat Australia', because the only way to beat Australia is to win the games before,\" says Vaughan. \"You can't suddenly arrive in an Ashes to beat that side having not beaten the other teams. \"It became obvious we were going to have a fresher team, a younger team, a team that had very little baggage. What was very clear in 2002-03, understandably, once we'd lost the first Test it was 'here we go again', because a lot of those players had been around the England side in the 1990s.\" Those unforgettable eight weeks of summer in 2005 etched the names of Vaughan and his players into English cricketing folklore. Steve Harmison drawing blood from Ponting, and Andrew Strauss' catch. Kevin Pietersen's hair and Gary Pratt's direct hit. Andrew Flintoff's batting. Andrew Flintoff's bowling. Andrew Flintoff's drinking. Because of injuries that occurred even before the series ended, the class of 2005 never played together again. \"That moment when you win is the best moment, but also quite deflating because it's all over,\" says Vaughan. \"All the stress and pressure were hard to deal with, but you get adrenaline from being in a series like that. When it's over you wonder what's next.\" Vaughan did not know it at the time, but lifting the urn was to be his last act as an Ashes cricketer. His troublesome knees meant he played only two more Tests in the 18 months that followed, including missing the defence in Australia in 2006-07. Under the captaincy of Flintoff, and a shadow of the team that won in 2005, England were dismantled 5-0 by an Australia side determined for revenge. \"We got absolutely hammered, and would have got hammered with me playing,\" says Vaughan. \"We poked the bear. \"It was hard to watch, because a lot of my mates were playing. Once we beat that Australia team once, they weren't going to allow us to beat them twice, especially in their own backyard.\" Vaughan tearfully stepped down as England skipper in 2008, although still with thoughts of playing in the home Ashes of 2009 under the captaincy of Strauss. Form and knees didn't allow it. In the four years between Ashes series played in this country, Vaughan went from winning captain to former cricketer. He retired at the age of 34. \"Straussy rang me and said he wanted me to get runs in county cricket and we'd have a look, but my body was knackered,\" says Vaughan. \"I couldn't do the training or the work. \"There was the odd morning I woke up and thought, 'come on, let's have a go at getting that batting slot'. I was thinking there was a chance. \"I probably retired a little bit too young, but I would have royally embarrassed myself in 2009.\" Considering his lofty standing in recent English cricketing history, Vaughan played relatively few Ashes Tests - 10 of them, five away and five at home. He will forever be remembered for what he achieved in 2005. It would not have been possible without what happened in 2002-03.",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump has not ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term for the White House, saying he would \"love to do it\". But Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice-president in 2028 - an idea floated by some supporters as a way for him to circumvent the US constitution that bars the president from running for a third term. Speaking to reporters during his trip to Asia, Trump described the idea as \"too cute\" and said it \"wouldn't be right\". It is unclear what method he would use to run again. Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon said that a \"plan\" was in place to secure the 79-year-old president another term. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Japan from Malaysia, Trump said that while he would \"be allowed\" to run again as vice-president, he had no plans to do so. \"I think people wouldn't like that,\" he said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\" Talking about the possibility of a third term, Trump said: \"I haven't really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.\" Additionally, Trump also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\". \"All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they don't,\" he added, referring to Democrats. The 22nd amendment of the US constitution bars presidents from seeking a third term. Repealing the amendment would require approval from two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, or a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of state legislatures - a process viewed as highly unlikely. The amendment would also need to have the backing of 38 states to ratify it, or making it officially valid. Last week, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon - who remains a vocal supporter - claimed there was a \"plan\" to secure a third term for Trump. \"Trump is going to be president in '28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" Bannon told The Economist. \"At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is.\" In March, Trump told CNBC he would \"probably not\" run again, though he later said he was \"not joking\" about the possibility. It is still unclear which Democrats intend to run for the White House in 2028, although several have already expressed an interest. On Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that he would \"be lying\" if he said he was not giving serious thought to a presidential bid. Former vice-president Kamala Harris also told the BBC she may run again and that she could \"possibly\" be president in the future.",

        "title": "Picture of health: going to art galleries can improve wellbeing, study reveals",
        "content": "Enjoying original works of art in a gallery can relieve stress, reduce the risk of heart disease and boost your immune system, according to the first study of its kind. Researchers measured the physiological responses of participants while viewing masterpieces by world-renowned artists including Manet, Van Gogh and Gauguin in a gallery. They found that art positively influences the immune, hormone and nervous systems all at once  something never previously recorded. The findings suggest that seeing original art not only moves people emotionally, but also calms the body and promotes health and wellbeing. The study, led by Kings College London, involved 50 people aged between 18 and 40 in the UK. Half viewed original artwork at the Courtauld Gallery in London, while the other half looked at copies of the same paintings in a non-gallery environment. The two groups wore sensors that continually measured their heart rates and skin temperature during the 20-minute session, with saliva samples also taken before and after viewing. From these samples, researchers found that levels of the stress hormone cortisol fell by an average of 22 among those viewing original art, compared with just 8 looking at reproductions. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) linked to stress and a number of chronic diseases fell by 30 and 28 respectively among those in the gallery, with no changes in the other group. This suggests art has a potential calming effect on the bodys inflammatory responses. Dr Tony Woods, a researcher at Kings College London, said: The research clearly shows the stress-reducing properties of viewing original art and its ability to simultaneously excite, engage and arouse us. Stress hormones and inflammatory markers like cortisol, IL-6 and TNF-alpha are linked to a wide range of health problems, from heart disease and diabetes to anxiety and depression. The fact that viewing original art lowered these markers suggests that cultural experiences may play a real role in protecting both mind and body. The study also found that art engages the immune system, the nervous system and the endocrine system, which is responsible for releasing hormones. Researchers detected signs of excitement among those viewing art in the gallery, including a dip in skin temperature, overall higher heart rates and a variation in heartbeat patterns. From a scientific perspective, the most exciting outtake is that art had a positive impact on three different body systems  the immune, endocrine and autonomic systems  at the same time, Woods said. This is a unique finding and something we were genuinely surprised to see. In short, our unique and original study provides compelling evidence that viewing art in a gallery is good for you and helps to further our understanding of its fundamental benefits. In essence, art doesnt just move us emotionally  it calms the body too. The emotional intelligence of each person was also assessed before the study using questionnaires but researchers said this had no impact on individual responses. Jenny Waldman, the director of the Art Fund, which co-funded the study, said: This study proves for the first time what weve long felt at Art Fund  that art really is good for you. Whats particularly exciting is that the findings show these benefits are universal  they can be experienced by anyone. We want to encourage everyone to make time to visit their local museum or gallery and experience these powerful effects for themselves.",

        "content": "A man has been arrested for approaching two of Australias women cricketers and allegedly touching them inappropriately in Indore, Indian police said on Saturday. The incident occurred on Thursday in Indore, a day off for the team after their six-wicket victory over England . He has been charged under sections 74 and 78 of the criminal code that deal with assault or using criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty and stalking, respectively. We are examining if there were any shortfalls in the security protocols, Dandotiya added. Cricket Australia had earlier said in a statement: We can confirm two members of the Australian womens team were approached and touched inappropriately by a motorcyclist while walking to a cafe in Indore. The matter was reported by team security to police who are handling the matter. The players have been offered support, and will continue playing in the tournament. The International Cricket Council has been approached for comment. Devajit Saikia, secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, said it was a deeply regrettable and isolated incident. He continued: We appreciate the swift and effective action taken by the Madhya Pradesh Police in apprehending the accused. The law will take its due course to ensure justice is served We will also review our existing safety protocols and strengthen them further, if necessary, to ensure such incidents are not repeated. News of an arrest broke as Australia took to the field for their final-round match , with a spot in the semi-finals already secured. Australia have spent large parts of this tournament in Indore, with Saturdays seven-wicket thrashing of South Africa their third game at Holkar Stadium. Alana King took a record seven for 18, the spinners seven-over spell routing South Africa for 97 in 24 overs, while Australia chased the total down with 98 for three in only 16.5 overs. It was the best bowling spell at the Womens Cricket World Cup  the first instance of a seven-wicket haul in tournament history.

        "title": "HMRC cuts child benefit for 35,000 families based on incomplete travel data",
        "content": "Parents who went from Liverpool to Amsterdam with their autistic children are among thousands who have had their child benefit wrongly stopped as part of a crackdown on benefit fraud, it has emerged. The error by HM Revenue and Customs emerged 48 hours after the Guardian and the Detail reported on hundreds of families in Northern Ireland who had child benefit stopped after they returned home from holiday via Dublin airport , leaving HMRC with the impression they had taken a one-way ticket out of the country and were fraudulently collecting child benefit. It has now come to light that HMRC sent out letters questioning the residency of almost 35,000 of the 6.9m in receipt of child benefit across the UK. Also among those whose benefits were frozen are a woman who went to France for five days after her husband died there; a Lithuanian man, living and paying taxes in England for 24 years, who was caught after he went on a five-day holiday with his son to Italy via Stansted airport; a family from Hove who flew in and out of Gatwick on a trip to Australia; and a woman who flew to Bristol from Belfast for her grandmothers funeral but returned via Dublin airport. HMRC apologised to the families and admitted it had sent letters to 0.5 of the 6.9m claimants with payments suspended while inquiries continued. It said it expected the majority had been suspended correctly. It also said it was urgently reviewing the current process and actively considering options. But the parents who have had their child benefits stopped are furious. It does feel like you are being punished for going away, said Cerys, a music teacher. She took her three children on a one-day trip to Amsterdam from John Lennon airport in Liverpool, with the sole purpose of familiarising two of them, who have been diagnosed with autism, with flying. They left at 6am and returned that night to make sure they would make bedtime at home, to minimise anxiety. Child benefit are now saying that there is no evidence of me returning with my family so I need to produce a ridiculous amount of evidence to prove that I have not been living in Amsterdam since February. We flew out of and back into Liverpool airport the same day, she said. This is the one time in God knows how many years we have gone abroad. My son is eight now and this was the first time he was abroad, but we lost child benefit because of it, said Cerys. She said she initially thought the HMRC letter was a scam and now faces demands to provide original bank statements, letters from old and new schools and GP records to prove she is not a fraudster. What frustrates her further is that the government has universal credit records that show she is in the UK and has recently moved from Liverpool to Newcastle. But this was not cross-checked. The 60 a week she receives for the three children may not seem a lot, she says, but as she is freelance it is a vital part of her household budget.

Simon Pilbrow in Northern Ireland took a short break with his boys via Heathrow airport to Vienna in 2023. On Friday he received a letter saying that HMRC was stopping his benefits. He said: I called up HMRC. Im normally a pretty chilled person, but I was absolutely raging at having to prove that I live in my own country. Bit of a Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmare. They said I cant do anything. I said I work at Tesco, which is the kind of job that you cant really do working from Austria. Mark Blackmore, a theatre and event technician whose benefit was stopped after a holiday to Spain three years ago, has sent HMRC an invoice marked for wasting my time after he spent three hours putting documents together to prove he was still in the UK. They have certainly got my home address, which is where they sent this letter. And it isnt in Spain, he said. Matt and Judy, grandparents in Durham and the legal guardians of two autistic boys, have also been caught out. They travelled to France at Easter last year, with Matt driving via Newhaven and Dieppe and Judy following on a flight to Newcastle but returning with the rest of the family by car. An American with indefinite leave to remain, she had her passport stamped in France on the way in and the way out, proof that the trip was a holiday. Their benefits were stopped on 6 October and they fear it could be just a starting point to cut off any other benefits they might be getting for the two boys, aged 11 and 14. I can see how somebodys come up with a good idea: Why dont we check everyone whos left the country on a one-way ticket? But they havent checked whether they come back in or not, the couple said. This is clearly a fishing expedition based on a half-baked idea. Simple checks would show we always are here unless on holiday. HMRC said: While this affects a very small number of child benefit claimants, we are very sorry to those whose payments have been suspended incorrectly. They should respond to us as soon as possible so we can check their case, reinstate payments, and ensure no one is left out of pocket. Weve already taken swift action to amend our approach, including checking employment data first before suspending payments. The UK government launched the crackdown in August, claiming it could save 350m in benefit fraud. The Cabinet Office minister Georgia Gould said : From September well have 10 times as many investigators saving hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers money. Child benefit can be stopped if a claimant is outside the UK for more than eight weeks, the government said. The international travel data used by HMRC says shows that customers have left the UK and may have not returned without acknowledging that border data was incomplete or incorrect for many.

        "title": "Javier Milei hails ‘tipping point’ as his far-right party wins Argentina’s midterm elections",
        "content": "The party of Argentinas far-right president, Javier Milei, has won Sundays midterm elections after a campaign in which Donald Trump announced a 40bn bailout for the country and made continued aid conditional on the victory of his Argentinian counterpart. With more than 99 of ballots counted, La Libertad Avanza secured 40.8 of the nationwide vote, in an election widely seen as a de facto referendum on the self-styled anarcho-capitalists nearly two years in power. The Peronist opposition, Fuerza Patria, secured 31.7. The Peronists remain the largest bloc by three seats. But when Mileis party is combined with the centre-right PRO party of the former president Mauricio Macri  which has voted with the government over the past two years  the president now has a larger bloc than the opposition to push through his libertarian policies. Mileis victory has surprised Argentine analysts and many say that even the government itself did not expect such an overwhelming result, given the recent blows to the libertarians popularity from corruption allegations involving his sister and the current economic crisis. The government had played down expectations, considering anything between 30 and 35 a satisfactory outcome, especially after Mileis heavy defeat in the provincial elections in Buenos Aires in September, when he lost to the Peronists by 14 percentage points. This time, Mileis party turned the tide, winning in Argentinas largest electoral district, home to about 40 of the electorate. I am the king of a lost world, Milei sang as he took the stage in front of hundreds of supporters at a hotel in Buenos Aires. He began his speech by saying: Today we passed the tipping point  the construction of a great Argentina begins. The president hailed the US bailout as something unprecedented, not only in Argentine history but in world history, because the US has never offered support of such magnitude. Now we are focused on carrying out the reforms that Argentina needs to consolidate growth and the definitive takeoff of the country  to make Argentina great again, the president said. Trump offered his congratulations on Sunday night, calling the win for Mileis party a landslide victory. On Monday, Trump said: He had a lot of help from us. He had a lot of help. I gave him an endorsement, a very strong endorsement, Trump said, also crediting some of his top officials, including the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who oversaw the financial assistance to Argentina. We are sticking with a lot of the countries in South America. We focus very much on South America. For the political scientist Miguel de Luca, Trumps support was decisive in preventing the countrys economy from deteriorating further in recent weeks. But I dont think it influenced voters decisions, he said. Markets reacted sharply to the surprise victory: shares rose more than 40 in pre-market trading and the Merval index posting its biggest one-day jump in 30 years, up almost 32. Dollar-denominated sovereign bonds climbed as much as 23. The result is being seen as a renewed wave of optimism that Mileis austerity plan and the US bailout could succeed. Up for grabs in the election were 127 of the 257 seats in the lower house and a third of the senate, 24 of its 72 seats. Mileis party secured 64 lower house seats and 13 in the senate. The new seats in the lower house, combined with those already held, allow the government to meet its main goal for this election: securing at least a third of the lower house to sustain presidential vetoes. Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you whats happening and why it matters Milei performed better in Sundays elections than he did in the first round of the 2023 vote, when he came second before winning in the runoff . Midterms in Argentina are typically setbacks for sitting presidents, and he is only the third to have achieved a better result than when first elected. Even with a working majority when his party is combined with PRO, Milei still needs about 20 more deputies to pass laws and reforms  meaning he will have to negotiate with governors outside his coalition, who wield significant influence over members of congress. Milei comes out stronger from the election and wins a second chance, said De Luca. It remains to be seen whether he takes advantage of it by opening negotiations with moderate governors or continues with his governing alone style, without allies. Milei began his administration almost two years ago with his chainsaw spending cuts, slashing tens of thousands of public jobs and freezing investment in infrastructure, healthcare, education and even the supply of medicines for pensioners. He managed to bring down inflation from more than 200 in 2023 to about 30 in September, and achieved the countrys first fiscal surplus in 14 years. Economic activity grew by 0.3 in August 2025 after three consecutive months of decline. But purchasing power has plummeted: most Argentinians say they are struggling to make ends meet, more than 250,000 jobs have been lost and about 18,000 businesses have closed. The libertarians popularity also took a hit when Milei promoted a cryptocurrency that later collapsed; his sister and most powerful cabinet member , Karina Milei, was implicated in an alleged corruption scheme ; and one of his partys leading candidates withdrew from Sundays election after admitting to having received 200,000 from a businessman accused of drug trafficking in the US. To prevent the peso from devaluing, the government burned through its dollar reserves, even after taking a 20bn loan (of which 14bn has been disbursed) from the International Monetary Fund, and was forced to turn to Trump, who came to the rescue with a 40bn bailout. Trumps stance was seen by many in the country as interference in the election, and some predicted that  owing to anti-American sentiment among parts of the population  it could backfire on Milei. Although voting is compulsory, turnout was the lowest since the return to democracy in 1983, at 67.85, surpassing the previous record low of 71 set in 2021.",

        "title": "Turkey likely to be excluded from Gaza stabilisation force after Israeli objection",
        "content": "Turkey will probably be excluded from the 5,000-strong stabilisation force that is to be set up inside Gaza after Israel made clear it did not want Turkish troops taking part. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said it was a requirement that Israel is comfortable with the nationality of the multinational force, set up to prevent a security vacuum when the massive task of reconstruction in Gaza starts. Turkey has said it is willing to offer troops, but Israel has let it be known that it disapproves of Turkish troops taking part in the force. Tensions between Israel and Turkey have grown over Syria and the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is seen by the Israeli government as too close to the Muslim Brotherhood and to Hamas itself. But the exclusion of Turkey from the stabilisation force would be controversial since it is one of the guarantors of the Trump 20-point ceasefire agreement, and is seen as one of the most capable Muslim armed forces. The force is still likely to be led by Egypt . Other contributors to the stabilisation force, such as Indonesia and the Emiratis, would still prefer the force to be given a UN security council mandate, even if it is not itself a UN peacekeeping force. Instead it will coordinate with a US-led military cell, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC), based in the southern Israeli town of Kiryat Gat. The cell, which includes a small number of British, French, Jordanian and Emirati advisers was inaugurated on Tuesday by the US vice-president, JD Vance. The CMCC also appears to be taking on an aid coordination role in Gaza , although key aid crossings remain closed. The force will be tasked with disarming Hamas and securing a transitional Palestinian government, the formation of which is still being contested. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , has ruled out Palestinian Authority involvement in postwar Gaza, although on Friday the main Palestinian factions agreed that an independent committee of technocrats would take over the running of the strip. In a sign of the tensions between Turkey and Israel, Turkish disaster response specialists sent to help locate Palestinian and Israeli bodies inside Gaza remained near Egypts border with the strip on Thursday, awaiting Israeli authorisation to enter. The 81-member team from Turkeys AFAD disaster management authority are waiting to enter with life-detection devices and trained search dogs. Erdoğan told reporters on Friday that the US should do more to put pressure on Israel, including through sanctions and arms sales bans, to abide by its commitments in the Trump plan. Rubio also said there could be no role for the UNs Palestinian relief works agency, Unrwa, in Gaza due to the agency being a subsidiary of Hamas. His remarks will put him at odds with many European countries, the UN itself, and the international court of justice (ICJ), which said in an advisory opinion this week that the Unrwa was an irreplaceable vehicle to distribute aid inside Gaza. The ICJ did not accept that Israel had provided incontrovertible evidence that Unrwa had been irretrievably infiltrated by Hamas. Joint US-Israeli opposition to Unrwa presents a dilemma since Donald Trump, in his 20-point plan, has accepted a role for the UN in distributing aid in Gaza, but seems intent on excluding Unrwa, the main relevant aid agency. The UN faces a choice over whether or not to confront Trump over Unrwa. A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day Norway, the country that initiated the action at the UN general assembly last December that led to the ICJ opinion this week, had said it was drafting a resolution incorporating the key ICJ findings about the need for Israel as the occupying power not to restrict aid supplies into Gaza. Under the Trump ceasefire plan, accepted by Israel, 600 aid trucks were due to enter Gaza daily. But since the agreement, the daily average has been 89 trucks a day on average  only 14 of the agreed amount. Unrwa criticised Israel, saying: Since the start of the war in Gaza, the West Bank, occupied by Israel since 1967, including East Jerusalem, has also seen a sharp escalation of violence. Families know only fear and uncertainty. The growing annexation of the West Bank continues unabated, in flagrant violation of international law. This must stop. The future of Gaza and the West Bank are one. The head of the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, Tom Fletcher, speaking to the BBC, said of his recent visit to Gaza: It felt to me like I was driving through the ruins of Hiroshima, or Stalingrad, or Dresden. Delegations from Hamas led by Khalil al-Hayya, and its rival, Fatah , led by Hussein Al-Sheikh, met in Egypt on Friday to discuss post-war arrangements in the Gaza Strip. Hamas said it had received clear guarantees from mediators that the war has effectively ended. A joint statement published on the Hamas website said the groups had agreed during a meeting in Cairo to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a temporary Palestinian committee composed of independent technocrats, which will manage the affairs of life and basic services in cooperation with Arab brothers and international institutions.",

        "title": "The Anthony Bourdain Reader review – undiscovered gems from the charismatic chef turned writer",
        "content": "T hink Anthony Bourdain and a whole rush of TV memories flood back. There he is  in shows such as Parts Unknown and No Reservations  a gonzo gourmand trekking to backstreet nooks and favela hideouts in parts of the world where celebrity chefs fear to tread. In Beirut and Congo; savouring calamari and checking out graffiti in Tripoli; slurping rice noodles and necking bottles of cold beer with Barack Obama in Hanoi, Vietnam. One course follows another, evenings drift past midnight and hes still chewing the fat with locals, hungry for stories  about drugs, dissidence, gristly local politics. But Bourdain, who killed himself aged just 61 in 2018, had always seen himself as a writer. His mother was an editor at the New York Times, and his youthful crushes were mostly beatniks and outlaws  Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, Lester Bangs, Hunter S Thompson. (Orwell too  especially his account of a dishwashers life in Down and Out in Paris and London.) A college dropout, he later signed up for a writing workshop with famed editor Gordon Lish. His earliest bylines appeared in arty, downtown publications; two crime novels (Bone in the Throat, Gone Bamboo) got decent reviews but sold poorly. Things turned around after the publication in 2000 of his bestselling memoir Kitchen Confidential. It portrayed New Yorks restaurants as sweatshops, military trenches, last chance saloons for a whole bevy of social misfits. For Bourdain they were refuges. A teenager whod been into Abbie Hoffman and Eldridge Cleaver, he later became a heroin addict, a fan of the Ramones and the Voidoids, a dive bar denizen. Week by week the city was getting Bloomberged, momnpop stores giving way to salad bars and frozen-yoghurt parlours: with its swaggering, screw-faced evocation of a rawer, less pasteurised New York, his was a book of mourning as much as it was one of celebration. By 2011 HarperCollins had given Bourdain his own publishing imprint. By 2016 The New Yorker was describing him as not actually a star  a nebula. Now his agent Kimberly Witherspoon has compiled The Anthony Bourdain Reader, drawn not only from his best-known books, but also handwritten short stories, chapters from unfinished novels, something he calls Another Pointless Journalistic Play and ghost-themed comics featuring Japanese spirits with a fondness for preying on balls of flesh located inside human anuses. Theres even a travel diary entry from 1973: My stomach and intestines hurt. I have contributed more shit and more vomit to the Florence sewer system than I did at home in a year. This head-to-tail editorial approach wont be to everyones taste. Bourdains fictional writing lacks the urgency and gamey flavour of his journalistic dispatches. Good food, good eating, is all about blood, organs, cruelty and decay, he once wrote, and some of the most memorable passages involve noshing on a braised bat (imagine braised inner tube, sauced with engine coolant), sampling the still-beating heart of a cobra (like chewing on a rubber dog toy), watching farm workers plunge a knife into a pigs thorax (the screaming penetrated the fillings in my teeth, echoed through the valley). Is this the food and travel porn that at one stage he fears he may be guilty of producing? At his worst, Bourdains carnivorousness and his screeds against vegans, Peta supporters or anyone campaigning against toxic chemicals read like libertarian shtick, manna for Top Gear stans. Complaining that people can no longer smoke in bars, he huffs, its only a matter of time before some well-intentioned health Nazi busts into your bedroom and yanks that post-intercourse cigarette right outta your hand. Then again, Christopher Hitchens might applaud his anti-Kissinger diatribe: While Henry continues to nibble nori rolls and remake at A-list parties, Cambodia, the neutral nation he secretly and illegally bombed, invaded, undermined, and then threw to the dogs, is still trying to raise itself up on its one remaining leg. Some of the loveliest passages come when Bourdain writes with just-so tenderness and precision about his family: a journey with his brother to La Teste-de-Buch in France among whose sand dunes they holidayed as young men; the outsize pleasure he takes in his five-year-old daughter nibbling on Pecorino and an anchovy. I suspect Bourdain will be read in years to come less as a writer about food than of food work. Everywhere he lands  whether in struggling bistros, mob joints or midtown nightclubs  he warms to the subaltern caste of underpaid toilers slicing and sizzling and sweating away. One of them, a century ago, was Irish-born Mary Mallon, later demonised as Typhoid Mary. In his passionate defence of her, he talks about what its like to grow old as a cook. The pains in the back, the knees. Perhaps the heart. Where once you would have turned your head to cough, you turn no longer. Wash your hands after going to the bathroom? Maybe  Unwashed hands, an errant cigarette ash, a roasted chicken dropped on a dirty kitchen floor and retrieved on the bounce  Weve been there, you and me and Mary.

        "title": "China spy row: Berry knew some of his contacts were non-commercial, messages suggest",
        "content": "Christopher Berry, the man at the heart of a controversial and now-abandoned Chinese espionage case, appeared to be aware that he was supplying information to a non-commercial client, according to messages seen by the Guardian. In August 2022, Berry sent a voice note saying that they want me to work for them directly instead of going through the company. The messages are included in an expert report written for Berrys defence team by Kerry Brown, the director of the Lau China Institute at Kings College London. The report was first leaked to the law and politics podcast Double Jeopardy, which is hosted by Tim Owen KC and the former director of public prosecutions Ken MacDonald KC. Brown, at the request of Berrys legal team, has not shared the report. Berry and the former parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, who were charged under the Official Secrets Act, have maintained their innocence and were also approached for comment on Monday. Berrys lawyer said they would be making no further comment. They were charged in April 2024 in relation to more than 30 reports that Berry wrote for a Chinese handler between December 2021 and February 2023. The Guardian understands that Berry was paid about 20,000 for these reports. Cash did not receive any money. In a statement on 16 October, Berry said his reports were provided to a Chinese company which I believed had clients wishing to develop trading links with the UK. Those reports contained no classified information and concerned economic and commercial issues widely discussed in the UK at the time and drew on information freely in the public domain, together with political conjecture, much of which proved to be inaccurate, he said. The Crown Prosecution (CPS) believed that the reports were in fact commissioned by an individual assessed to be a Chinese intelligence agent. Browns defence report, seen by the Guardian, includes messages that suggest Berry was aware that some of his contacts came from a non-commercial background. On 15 July 2022, weeks before Berry sent the message about being asked to work for them directly, he had a meeting with someone under conditions of some levels of secrecy, according to Browns summary of Berrys messages. Berry later said that he had to Google the person to figure out who they were. After being told about the meeting, Cash wrote to Berry:  Youre in spy territory now , according to the governments witness statement . Cash has complained that the statements shared publicly are devoid of the context that would have been given at trial. The CPS believed that Berry had met Cai Qi , then the Chinese Communist party (CCP) secretary for Beijing and a member of the CCPs executive body, the politburo. Berry denies that he ever met Cai, who is now the de facto chief of staff to Xi Jinping, Chinas president. China experts, including Brown, are sceptical that someone of Cais rank could have met a foreign national as junior as Berry. At the time of the alleged meeting in Hangzhou, Cai was in Beijing, a two-hour flight away. On 29 November 2022, Berry messaged Cash to say that the politburo guy had been back in contact. The man asked Berry to find out if Rishi has secretly been funding these white paper revolution guys or supporting them in some clandestine way. Cash is understood to have taken politburo guy to mean general CCP member, rather than someone from the 24-man Politburo. Days earlier, mass protests involving thousands of people had erupted in cities across China in demonstrations against the harsh zero-Covid policies in place at the time. Rishi Sunak was at that time the UK prime minister. Berry wrote to Cash that it was funny that he thinks I would know if rishi had done it. I basically just summarize guardian articles most of the time. The messages in Browns report, which are only a sample of the reportedly more than 1,000 pages of WhatsApp evidence, also show Berry and Cash joking about passing on disinformation to bring about regime collapse in China. In May 2022, Berry said to Cash that he had been asked to make a list of influential thinktanks in the UK that helped shape the UKs China policy. Do you reckon I should throw in some red herrings to troll? Berry said. In November 2022, Berry wrote that he wished to make them the Chinese do something almost fully retarded just to see what we can get them to do just by telling them. The CPS dropped charges against Cash and Berry on 15 September, prompting a huge controversy. The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

        "title": "Milei’s win in Argentina had Trump’s fingerprints all over it. But just how long will their friendship last?",
        "content": "I n 1946, Argentina was emerging from military rule, an empowered labour movement was reshaping politics and Col Juan Perón, a leftwing leader who had introduced a raft of popular workers rights decrees, was rising fast in the polls. The then US ambassador, Spruille Braden, had other ideas about who should win the national election that year, and he openly campaigned against Perón in Buenos Aires. Bradens action stands out as one of the most brazen instances of US interference in Argentinas politics. Until now . The Argentine president, Javier Milei, who won a resounding midterm victory on Sunday, has received ample support from Donald Trump. Ahead of the congressional elections, Trump endorsed Milei and warned: If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina. Washington extended a 20bn currency swap line to the government  money aimed at stabilising financial volatility that would have undermined Mileis chances. The US treasury even intervened directly, buying more than a billion dollars of pesos to slow the currencys freefall in recent weeks. Trumps bailout of Argentina is not an act of economic prudence (economists across the spectrum say it makes no sense ), but of ideological finance. The goal is to shore up an ally in the USs back yard and discredit opponents, especially the leftwing Perónist tendency in Argentinian politics that Trump equates with his own domestic opponents . Historically, Washington dressed up these types of ideological interventions as serving the greater good, defined in terms of US interests. But Trump has dispensed with even that pretence. For him, foreign policy is not strategic: its anchored by personal loyalties. Guardian columnists and writers on what theyve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more The US administration has punished Latin American leaders who have dared to resist Trump. Brazils government has weathered punitive sanctions against officials in retaliation for prosecuting the former president Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who attempted a coup. The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, has been personally sanctioned by Scott Bessents treasury department . Venezuela faces lethal US strikes on vessels off its coast. The disciplinary message to the region is clear: Washington will use its financial and military power to reward obedience and punish dissent. For Argentina, this kind of interference has a long pedigree. Bradens crusade against Juan Perón was also driven by ideological paranoia. Yet the approach failed. Peróns supporters rallied under the slogan Braden o Perón, painting the fight as a stark choice between foreign interference and national sovereignty. Perón won, and his political legacy has defined Argentine politics ever since. He later quipped that if Braden had not existed, we would have had to invent him. Peróns voters 80 years ago werent just motivated by the symbolism of US interference. They voted to reject a political status quo that was deaf to their needs. Likewise, for an electorate exhausted by years of economic and social crises, Milei and Trumps campaign succeeded by focusing voters energies on the failures of the old political establishment. Still, Mileis voters had numerous motivations. A significant portion of Mileis vote, I would say a little over half of what he obtained, is an electorate that is still hopeful and confident about the future, says Shila Vilker, director of Argentine pollster firm Trespuntozero. Another significant chunk were concerned that US financial assistance would be conditional on the elections results. Some were scared of the unknown, others wanted to reject Perónism. Having won the election, Mileis challenge will now be to manage monetary policy. The government had been burning through reserves to maintain the pesos value. US assistance was explicitly a stopgap . A temporary influx of dollars will not rescue a programme that is failing its own electorate  and in the longer term, Argentine voters are unlikely to be swayed by foreign patronage. Trumps attempts to weaponise foreign policy in the region have often misfired. In Brazil, his assault on democratic institutions helped to bolster the popularity of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In Panama, the governments deference to American demands over Chinas access to the canal has sparked domestic anger. For now, Milei has bucked this trend. He has secured a minority in congress that shields his austerity agenda from legislative vetoes. His symbolic victory was also enormous: he won by a single point in Buenos Aires province, a bastion of Perónism . That Mileis libertarian experiment already needs rescuing underscores its failure. Inflation has eased, but austerity has choked growth and gutted subsidies for transport, energy, health and education, making it harder for the countrys poor to make it to the end of the month. Wages are 6 less in real terms than they were just before Milei took office, and a Big Mac costs more in Argentina than in New York. Confidence in the government has plummeted, and belief in a better future has fallen from 48 to 34 in 2025 . Trumps foreign policy is ideological, but its also markedly volatile. On Sunday he met with his ideological enemy Lula da Silva, who, despite US tariffs and sanctions, has spiritedly refused to compromise on the prosecution of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro. After months of acrimony, Lula and Trump are now reportedly working to reach a trade agreement. For all Trumps bluster about friendship, his interventions lay bare a truth that Latin America has long understood: Washingtons priorities seldom align with the needs of those who live with their consequences.

        "content": "In the middle of a tough workout, I put my imagination in a survival situation. I pretend I havent had water for several days in a desert. Im parched. I need to drill down to my last drop of strength to arrive at the oasis. (OK, its an ego fantasy as well as one of survival.) I feel the relentless desert heat, but refuse to slow down. I push and push, and then  oh wow, that stream of cool, clean water flowing down my throat at the end is like a magical elixir. Diana Nyad , long-distance swimmer and motivational speaker When I feel weighed down by unanswered emails or tedious admin tasks, I turn to tidying a small space. It might be my bag or a corner of a drawer  just one manageable spot. Even this tiny act of tidying clears my head, lifts my energy and sparks the motivation to get moving again. Because tidying involves physical movement, I often use that momentum to tackle the very tasks Ive been putting off. Marie Kondo , organising consultant and author When it comes to cleaning my home, racing to finish a task before a song or playlist comes to an end is helpful. I like to see what I can achieve to The Saturdays Greatest Hits Megamix , which is around seven minutes long. Its amazing what you can achieve in a short amount of time when you crack on. Iwan Carrington , author of Clean in 15: Create a Clean  Happy Home in Minutes Two things motivate me: death and deadlines . The easiest and most enjoyable way to keep death ever-present in the mind is to read the obituaries every morning. When I read about people who did something with their lives, it makes me want to do something with mine. Austin Kleon , author of Keep Going: 10 Ways to Stay Creative in Good Times and Bad I only allow myself to watch my favourite lowbrow TV shows while exercising. That means I end every workout wanting more and look forward to my time on the cross-trainer. This is how Ive watched shows such as Bridgerton, Emily in Paris, Never Have I Ever, The Sex Lives of College Girls, Ted Lasso and more. Katy Milkman , author of How to Change: The Science of Getting to Where You Want to Be When I need to push through a workout, Ive got a few motivators on rotation. I once read that exercise is like a shotgun blast of health for the body, so I imagine that. Other times its more personal: I move for my dad, whos too sick to move himself, or I remind myself that after giving birth to two kids, this is a piece of cake. I also hear my old coach, Rob Shaul, in my head yelling Suck it up!, which never fails. Mintra Tilly, director of sports at fitness company Hyrox It might seem incongruous for an Ironman athlete to talk about making things as easy as possible, but hear me out. Dont think about moving mountains, think about taking one small, easy step. If I cant motivate myself to go for a run, I put my shoes on and open the door. Once I get there, I step out and run four or five steps. Once I have that momentum, I continue  and so does my motivation. I log my progress in a training diary, ensuring I bank feelings of euphoria to draw on in future, and can be buoyed up by memories of times when I completed sessions that I didnt want to do. Chrissie Wellington , four -time Ironman triathlon world champion I say the word yes over and over again  in my mind or out loud. One syllable. Its positive and it gets you into a motivated mindset. Emily Harrington , professional rock climber Sometimes when we lack motivation or procrastinate, theres a reason. Often, its because there is some fear or reluctance to do something; maybe we think we wont be able to manage or cope with it. Ask yourself exactly what youre worried about. You can sometimes then see the fears are not real or at least not as large as you might believe. It may just be that youre focusing on these feelings of not wanting to start, but turn it around and ask yourself how youll feel, or the repercussions, if you dont begin that task. Often those feelings will be more scary or worrying. This helps me to start  because its the least worst option! Dr Radha M odgil, author of Know Your Own Power: Inspiration, Motivation and Practical Tools for Life I like to keep a tally of hours spent doing deep work each day  thats time spent focusing on cognitively demanding tasks without opening emails or having meetings. When I find myself, in the moment, wanting to avoid hard work for busyness, I ask myself: how will you feel tonight when you put down a big zero for your daily deep work hours? That often helps. Cal Newport, author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World I have been walking up the six flights of stairs to my office since the lift broke at the start of the year, and carried on even when it was mended. I get through this by lying to myself about how many flights there are to go. I repeat one, one, one as I step, because if I count properly it seems to take for ever. So this is basically a strategy to stop me counting for real and then chickening out as its so many steps. I find this both makes it easier, stopping me thinking about how many stairs there are to go, and means reaching my floor is a pleasant surprise. Prof Sophie Scott , director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London My mini motivator is Clive. Hes a pink-haired, inch-high troll that my niece gave me while I was doing IVF for my now grownup triplets. He was there for egg harvesting, reimplantation and birth. He symbolised support and care. Ive since taken him on every expedition, and when its tough and Ive used all my motivators (chanting my childrens names is favourite), I take comfort from his presence and keep going. Hes not just useful for expeditions. I regularly speak at corporate events and always have nerves beforehand. I never go on stage without him. Ann Daniels , polar explorer I swear, if I get more than one of my senses actively involved, I can suddenly do tasks I couldnt do mere moments ago. There is something about tuning into your senses that gives the mind a reset, an opportunity to get off the hamster wheel of dread and recalibrate into the current moment. This could be lighting a candle while playing moody music in order to focus on yoga lesson planning. It could be getting a drink and eating an apple before I settle in for Zoom calls. Ive also been known to step outside to feel the Texas sun on my skin before slaying my chores. Its really hard for me to put away laundry. I need the cross-sensory boost to gear my body and brain up for the tasks at hand, especially if they feel big that day. Adriene Mishler , host of Yoga with Adriene To get through boring admin, I set a 15-minute timer on my phone. Heres what happens in your brain when you do that: the open-ended anxiety of this could take for ever gets replaced with I just need to focus for X minutes. Fifteen minutes is the sweet spot for many people  long enough to make real progress, short enough to feel manageable even on difficult days or really tedious tasks. Usually, one of two things happens: the task doesnt take anywhere near as long as you thought, or you get into the flow and its nowhere near as bad as you thought it would be. Before you know it, the task is done. Mia Northrop , co-founder of life coaching company Life Admin Life Hacks Whenever I find my motivation dipping, Ill go for a device-free walk around the block. This may sound like procrastination, but its the opposite. A device-free walk always helps me reorient toward the task at hand. If Im distracted, being device-free helps settle my mind. If Im putting a task off, I can reflect on whats making me not want to do it  and form a plan to combat that aversion. Chris Bailey , author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less and Achieve More Before decluttering or organising a space, I visualise how the newly organised space will make me feel. Daunted at the thought of organising all those coats and shoes jumbled at the front door? Imagine the ease and calm of stepping into the right pair of shoes and taking your favourite jacket as you leave the house in the morning. About to dive into sorting out the toy mountain? Imagine a sitting room where you can do a quick tidy in five minutes because everything has a home. Mel Carruthers , owner of decluttering service More Organised I remind myself not to wait for motivation as it rarely shows up. What matters is momentum, and momentum starts with something small: tidying one drawer, sending one email. That first step creates energy, and results follow with consistency. The truth is, most people give up because the vision in their head doesnt appear instantly, but real change is a process. Craig Hoareau , owner of house organisation company A Tidy Mind London",

        "content": "Inside a gold-drenched palace in Tokyo on Tuesday, President Trump heaped praise on Sanae Takaichi, Japans new prime minister, telling her that their countries were allies at the strongest level and vowing to come to Japans aide on any favors you need. The leaders signed two vaguely worded agreements  one declaring a new golden age of the US-Japan alliance, and another to cooperate on expanding the supply chain for rare earth metals  but there was little sign of any breakthrough in the details of the trade deal both countries signed onto in July. There was no public talk about a major point of contention between the two countries: the details of how Japan intends to spend a promised 550 billion investment into the United States. The promise came as part of the trade deal, and in return for the large investment, Japan was to receive a 15 percent tariff on its exports  a lower rate than Mr. Trump had initially threatened. Instead, both leaders focused more on what they had in common: A warm relationship with Shinzo Abe, the former Japanese prime minister who was assassinated in 2022. Ms. Takaichi is a protégé of his, and the Tuesday meeting was considered a major test of how well she had studied Mr. Abes approach to handling a mercurial American president. During Mr. Trumps visit to Tokyo in 2019, Mr. Abe treated the president to a round of golf, hibachi and a sumo match. Within minutes of meeting Mr. Trump, the new prime minister showed that she had closely studied that relationship. During the visit, she gave Trump a golf bag signed by Hideki Matsuyama, a Japanese professional golfer, and a putter that had belonged to Mr. Abe, along with a map of places within the United States that the Japanese plan to invest money, according to the White House.

        "title": "Don’t Count on Xi and Trump to Steady the World",
        "content": "When President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China meet this week the world will be watching to see if they can lock in a framework trade agreement and finally restore a sense of lasting stability and predictability to the worlds most consequential relationship. Whatever rhetoric or handshake deals come out of their planned encounter at a regional summit in South Korea, they are unlikely to signify more than a momentary truce between two leaders unchecked by domestic or institutional constraints and free to change course on a whim. Welcome to the new strongman era. If the world seems on edge these days, with alliances fraying, violent conflicts emerging and volatility as the order of the day, theres a reason. These are the early shocks of a world being shaped by leaders who govern by personal will instead of rules and consensus. Leaders like these are rising all over the globe  Nayib Bukele in El Salvador, Kais Saied in Tunisia and Viktor Orban in Hungary, along with well-established authoritarians such as Vladimir Putin of Russia and Kim Jong-un of North Korea. And now, for the first time in the U.S.-China relationship, the two countries are being led by men with similar political styles. The consequences, at least for the next four years, are likely to be profound: more risk-taking, volatility and potential for miscalculation and conflict. Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, and the nations they lead, differ of course in myriad ways. Yet both men have sought to bend their political systems to their will. Mr. Trump has hijacked the Republican Party and made it into a personal political vehicle. Mr. Xi asserts a degree of control over China that Mao would have envied. Their lack of domestic constraints gives them great latitude for deal-making, but it also makes any potential agreements flimsy and subject to change. Strongmen can be unreliable international partners. Surrounded by loyalists and weakened restraints on their power, they face few domestic consequences for reneging on promises or abruptly changing course. Weve seen this already from the two presidents: The Trump administration accuses China of failing to honor trade pledges made during Mr. Trumps first term, and Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly announced tariffs on trade partners this year only to reverse himself soon after. The lack of constraints can work against global security. Because strongmen are not held accountable, they do not have to make good on their word, so their threats lack credibility. Amid the bluster, their counterparts find it difficult to gauge where the red lines truly are  Mr. Trump delivered multiple ultimatums to Mr. Putin for a cease-fire in Ukraine that he has systematically ignored. In such an environment, guardrails for international behavior fade away, increasing the likelihood for conflict. A growing body of research shows that authoritarian leaders  surrounded by yes men who feed their egos and policy convictions  are more likely to take risks, start wars and escalate conflicts. Russias invasion of Ukraine is a prime example. Surrounded by his own set of sycophants, Mr. Putin gravely misjudged Ukraine, starting a war that has rattled the world. Mr. Trumps apparent extrajudicial killings of alleged drug smugglers in the Caribbean and his threats to attack Venezuela are in the same risk-taking vein, as are Chinas brazen military actions in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait under Mr. Xi. Interstate conflict is already on the rise. That may continue with leaders like these in charge. The consequences of strongman rule also seep into the fabric of economies and everyday life. Such leaders are more likely to attack independent domestic institutions like their central banks , as Mr. Trump is doing with the U.S. Federal Reserve, which threatens to stoke inflation and make it less predictable. Economic growth and equality often suffer under personalist autocracies , which tend to concentrate wealth among elites, suppress private investment that depends on consistent policies and neglect essential public goods such as education, health care and infrastructure. The trade war that Mr. Trump has initiated with China and other trading partners is already leading to economic disruption and predictions of slower global growth . Strongmen often pad their pockets and those of their loyalists and undermine their own economies by shifting assets offshore. Mr. Xis family, for example, has reportedly amassed over 1 billion in assets, even as he has used an anti-corruption campaign to purge his rivals. Mr. Trumps unrestrained second term has coincided with a spike in his family s involvement in deals involving Middle East real estate , cryptocurrency and licensing fees . Repression also rises as authoritarians fabricate fears about enemies within. Mr. Xis regime has jailed or silenced dissenting journalists and human rights lawyers, exaggerated an Islamist terrorism threat in Xinjiang to justify extreme repression there and eliminated Hong Kongs former freedoms in the name of national security. Mr. Trumps administration has launched immigration raids and deployed National Guard troops to Democratic Party strongholds, destroying private property and detaining U.S. citizens . He has launched politically motivated prosecutions of perceived enemies and sought to impose control over independent U.S. government agencies. The damage inflicted on political institutions and norms can be severe and difficult to undo. Poland, for example, faces challenges in restoring the independence of its judiciary, which was undermined from 2015 to 2023 during the rule of the Law and Justice Party and its leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski. What were experiencing today has in fact been the norm for much of history. Only in the last century or so did governance became more collegial, especially in the postwar period, when solid institutions, alliances and rules led to an unprecedented era of global peace and prosperity. That era is fading. And rather than provide reassurance about the relationship between the United States and China, this weeks meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi might represent something else: confirmation that the unpredictability and volatility of strongman rule is back.

        "title": "Japan’s new prime minister faces her biggest test yet: Meeting Trump",
        "content": "Months before she became Japans prime minister, Sanae Takaichi said shed been invited to meet US President Donald Trump. It was November, just after his election victory and several figures close to Trump had urged her to visit Washington, she posted on her official X account. But she declined, insisting then-Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba should be the first Japanese lawmaker to meet the new US leader. However, I aim to work hard toward holding a position that would allow me to meet him in a dignified manner someday, she wrote. Takaichis first major test on the global stage comes as she heads to the ASEAN summit in Malaysia and the APEC meeting in South Korea, trips that will reveal how much of her trademark conservative rhetoric she brings into office. But the most closely watched moment will come between those summits, when Trump visits Tokyo to meet Emperor Naruhito and sits down with Takaichi for the first time on Tuesday. Aboard Air Force One on his way to Asia, Trump spoke highly of Takaichi. The pair spoke on the phone Saturday, in what Trump called a very good phone call. She great, beautiful  Shes very friendly, he told reporters aboard Air Force One following the call. For Japans new leader, the stakes are high. Though the US-Japan alliance is one of the worlds strongest, Takaichis limited diplomatic experience and Trumps unpredictability make their first meeting a critical test. Their talks are expected to cover tariffs, regional security and Japans defense spending, all points of tension in recent months. Within Japans conservative ruling party, some worry Washingtons commitment to the Indo-Pacific is fading, as it demands more from allies. At home, Takaichi faces her own challenges. Her Liberal Democratic Party is still recovering from corruption scandals, and her performance abroad could shape both her political future and her partys recovery. Her approval rating sits at a strong 71, a number her team will be keen to preserve. Under former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Japan pledged to raise defense spending to 2 of GDP by 2027. Takaichi now wants to accelerate that timeline to March 2026, calling for Japan to proactively advance the fundamental strengthening of its defense capabilities at her first address in Japans parliament. But how the buildup will be financed remains unclear. With the yen weakening and Takaichi pushing tax cuts, she may struggle to fund her ambitions. Trade could prove equally thorny. Since returning to office, Trump has reignited his tariff wars, targeting even longtime allies. After months of talks, tariffs on Japanese goods dropped from 25 to 15 , while Tokyo agreed to invest 550 billion in US industries. But many details remain vague, and Takaichi is expected to seek more clarity. Shes also brought in veterans to help her navigate Washington. Her new cabinet includes negotiator Ryosei Akazawa, who led recent tariff talks, and several former aides from the administration of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, figures who built a strong rapport with Trump. Its a clear message to both domestic and international audiences that shes trying to carry on Abes line of thinking, rather than Kishidas or Ishibas, said Rintaro Nishimura, a Tokyo-based senior associate at The Asia Group, a consulting firm. Energy is also expected to surface. Japan still imports about 10 of its liquefied natural gas from Russia, a dependency Washington wants to curb. Tokyo has pledged to reduce the reliance, but says an abrupt cutoff could threaten its energy security. Takaichis handling of regional relations will also shape her success with Trump. Shes long been known for her hardline views: criticizing Chinas growing military presence in the region and adopting a conservative and nationalist tone on past issues with South Korea, where Japans history of colonialism and wartime sexual slavery still impacts relations to this day. Her visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which its nearest neighbors see as an homage to Japans past wartime aggressions, have also angered both of those nations. Yet since taking office, shes hinted at a softer approach. At her inaugural news conference as prime minister, she sought to alleviate worries of an anti-South Korea stance, lauding some of its most renowned exports. It seems there are various concerns, but I love Korean nori seaweed. I also use Korean cosmetics and watch Korean dramas, she said. Maintaining positive ties with South Koreas President Lee Jae Myung would continue the lattice-like foreign policy encouraged by Washington, one that favors multilateral cooperation among like-minded nations over bilateral dependence. Theres a growing understanding that Japan-South Korea cooperation is a necessity in this uncertain world, Nishimura said. If these two US allies deepen their defense ties, it helps reduce Americas burden in the region. Takaichis toughest balancing act may be China. Japan is walking a tightrope between the US and China, said Misako Iwamoto, a Mie University emeritus professor, who specializes in politics and womens studies. China remains Japans largest trading partner. Past leaders, such as Yukio Hatoyama in 2009, leaned closer to Beijing, sparking pushback from Washington. But unlike Hatoyama, Takaichi is seen as firmly right-wing, Iwamoto said. If she manages to improve ties with China in a way that doesnt appear anti-American, it might not cause too much friction. Both Trump and Takaichi take a hawkish stance on Beijing, particularly over Taiwan. Earlier this year, Takaichi visited the island and called for cooperation with Taiwan to jointly address defense challenges. Beijing condemned the trip as a dangerous provocation, warning that Japan was at a crossroads under her leadership. Even before her election, tensions were rising between the two neighbors. Chinese vessels have stepped up activity around the disputed Senkaku Islands  known as the Diaoyus in China  while Japans 2022 defense paper officially labeled China its greatest security threat for the first time. At her first press conference as prime minister, Takaichi vowed to take US-Japan relations to new heights, calling the alliance the cornerstone of Japans foreign and security policy. She ended her speech with a pointed line: There is no time to stand still. Shes right. Takaichi is diving into a sea of challenges, from restoring trust at home to finding Japans balance between Washington and Beijing. How she steers through them will not only define her premiership but could subtly shape the tone and depth of the US-Japan partnership in the years ahead.",

        "title": "Sen. McCormick defends Trump’s controversial moves, praises his Democratic counterpart as shutdown continues",
        "content": "Republican Sen. David McCormick defended Donald Trumps latest controversial moves in a rare interview, including the presidents 230 million request for the Justice Department to pay his legal bills, the demolition of the White Houses East Wing , and his partys handling of the government shutdown . He also compared Democrats to terrorists in the tense stalemate over reopening the government  though he later walked that back. But the Pennsylvania freshman, who won his seat last fall by about 15,000 votes, sings a different tune when it comes to his one-time political rival Sen. John Fetterman. My position has been from Day 1  open up the government. Thats where Sen. Fetterman, my counterpart, Democratic senator from Pennsylvania, has been, McCormick told CNNs Manu Raju in a wide-ranging interview for Inside Politics Sunday, adding that he would take the same tack if he were a member of the minority party. Fetterman has now voted 12 times with Republicans on a short-term bill to extend current government funding levels through November 21. Hes had the courage to stand up for what he believes in. We have found common ground, and when we find it, we work together, McCormick said of Fetterman, whom he calls an extraordinary partner. He dodged repeatedly when asked whether he thinks Fetterman, who hasnt yet said hell run for a second term in three years, should be reelected. I trust him. Cant always say that about people in Washington these days. I trust John Fetterman to do what he thinks is right and what he thinks is right for Pennsylvania, he said. McCormick emphasized that Fetterman, who insists hell remain a Democrat despite mounting disagreements with his caucus, is not a conservative by any stretch and said he hasnt urged him to change parties. What we agree on is that where we can find common ground, were going to work together for Pennsylvania. And thats, unfortunately, more rare these days than it should be, he lamented. He made clear hes less interested in finding common ground right now with most of Fettermans fellow Democrats, who are demanding assurances that Republicans will work with them to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the government. You cant negotiate with a terrorist, he said, calling the minority partys asks extremely unreasonable. You can have any negotiation, discussion you want about extending health care benefits, but you cant start with youre going to shut down the government to get them, he continued, aligning himself with the stance of Senate GOP leaders and Trump administration officials who have said they wont talk to Democrats until the shutdown ends. Pressed on his choice of the word terrorist to describe some of his Senate colleagues, McCormick responded that he thinks Democrats are irresponsibly imposing pain on the American people and holding (essential government services) hostage to try to get a political win. Thats just unacceptable, he asserted, later adding, we can have a discussion about health care, benefits and anything else, but we cant do it with a gun at our head. After the interview, McCormick told Raju that he meant to refer to Democrats as hostage takers  not terrorists. While Republicans show no signs of caving as the shutdown is almost certain to stretch into a fifth week, McCormick is among the GOP lawmakers who Democrats hope will be pressured to the negotiating table as their constituents begin to enroll in another year of health insurance with drastically higher premiums. He called former President Barack Obamas signature health care law a failure and argued that the purpose of the enhanced tax credits was to help overcome the ACAs shortcomings. Still, McCormick worries about the implications for many working Pennsylvanians, who could face 82 higher premiums, according to state estimates. A lot of people in Pennsylvania live paycheck to paycheck, and if their premiums go up dramatically, thats going to be a big deal, he said. Asked whether hed be in favor of extending ACA subsidies for another year, McCormick answered, I certainly support having that conversation, particularly as it affects working families. The fight in Congress comes ahead of next years midterm battle, when Democrats hope to mobilize voters around the issue of health care affordability. McCormick, who unseated a Democratic incumbent and won one of the closest Senate races in the country last year, said hes not concerned that Republicans position in this shutdown standoff might come back to hurt them in 2026. Of course his party is worried about health care costs, McCormick said, claiming that while Republicans are focused on addressing the issue, the political headline that voters will look to is the remarkable delivery of Trumps 2024 campaign promises. McCormick also says he isnt worried about some of the more controversial headlines generated by the president. He defends Trump where a few of his fellow Republicans express reservations and lauds him for sticking to campaign commitments that won his political ally the state of Pennsylvania  and the White House  by a larger margin than McCormick won to scoop up his seat. He noted Trump was a private citizen when he requested 230 million from the Justice Department as compensation for investigations into him, though those asks are still on the table and could ultimately result in the president receiving millions in taxpayer dollars. Pressed on the fact that Trump could just drop the request, McCormick responded, the president said that whatever happens, he wont benefit from it personally, so Id say let it go through the court system. It is however possible that the Justice Department, which Trump ultimately oversees as president, could agree to a monetary settlement before the issue makes it to a court. Though most of McCormicks Republican colleagues have dodged on the subject, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, who isnt running for reelection, bemoaned last week that news of a potential payment to Trump at the expense of taxpayers looks horrible amid a weekslong government shutdown. And McCormick also isnt concerned about the optics of Trumps demolition of the White Houses East Wing to build a massive ballroom. The project was underway, and its not being paid by taxpayer dollars, he said, calling the multimillion dollar project funded by wealthy donors and major companies small ball and tiny compared with the presidents efforts to make peace in war-torn Gaza and Ukraine. As the president continues to ramp up his wielding of executive power, often with very little input from Congress, McCormick rejects the premise that Trump is acting outside the boundaries of his office. The former Army captain said while he would like to be more updated on the series of recent US military strikes on alleged South American drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, he believes Trump is being consistent in what he told voters he would do to take on the cartels. If it was a president I didnt trust, Id want to know a lot more. But what hes doing is consistent with the promises he made, McCormick said. CNNs Jenna Monnin contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Former President Joe Biden called these dark days as he urged Americans to stay optimistic and not to check out in response to what he says are attacks on free speech and tests on the limits of executive power by President Donald Trump. Since its founding, America served as a beacon for the most powerful idea ever in government in the history of the world, Biden said Sunday. The idea is stronger than any army. Were more powerful than any dictator. Biden, 82, was speaking publicly for the first time since completing a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. He addressed an audience in Boston after receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Edward M. Kennedy Institute. He said America depends on a presidency with limited power, a functioning Congress and an autonomous judiciary. With the federal government facing its second-longest shutdown on record, Trump has used the lapse in funding to exercise new command over the government. Friends, I cant sugarcoat any of this. These are dark days, Biden said. He predicted the country would find our true compass again and emerge as we always have  stronger, wiser and more resilient, more just, so long as we keep the faith. Biden listed examples of people who are standing their ground against threats from the current administration, citing federal employees who resign in protest, and universities and comedians that have been targeted by Trump. The late-night hosts continue to shine a light on free speech knowing their careers are on the line, he said. Biden also shouted out Republican officials who vote against the Trump administration. America is not a fairy tale, he said. For 250 years, its been a constant push and pull, an existential struggle between peril and possibility. He finished the speech by telling people to get back up. The Democrat left office in January after serving one term in the White House. Biden dropped his bid for reelection after facing pressure following a disastrous debate against Trump and concerns about his age, health and mental fitness. Biden endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump last November. In May, Bidens post-presidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. Prostate cancers are graded for aggressiveness using what is known as a Gleason score. The scores range from 6 to 10, with 8, 9 and 10 prostate cancers behaving more aggressively. Bidens office said his score was 9. Biden, who will turn 83 in November, completed a course of radiation therapy earlier this month. It is unclear what the former presidents next treatment steps might be. Biden will also headline an event for the Nebraska Democratic Party in Omaha next month.",

        "title": "The magical white stone wonderland with effervescent bathing pools",
        "content": "From a distance, Pamukkale looks every bit like a ski resort, with a cascade of brilliant white slopes and a scattering of tourists at the top, seemingly preparing to slalom down into the valley below. So why isnt it melting away as midsummer temperatures nudge toward 100 Fahrenheit, or 37 Celsius, and the heat hangs in the shimmering air? Because this unusual and beautiful wonder, located deep in the sunkissed hills of southwestern Turkey, isnt snow at all. In fact the water its formed from sometimes spurts out of the ground at boiling point. And those visitors milling around its upper reaches arent going anywhere fast. Most are here to take in the extraordinary spectacle  and either paddle or soak in some of the planets most photogenic pools. Today, Pamukkales travertine limestone slopes and pools, filled with milky blue mineral water, are perfect for Instagram moments, especially as the magic hour evening sun casts their rippled surfaces in hues of pink. But this place was a tourist sensation thousands of years before social media, as first Greeks, then Romans flocked here for the thermal waters and to pay tribute at what was revered as a gateway to Hell. Today, Pamukkale and the ancient city of Hierapolis, which sprawls across the plateau above the white terraces, are part of a UNESCO World Heritage site that pulls in busloads of visitors. Typically, many visit for a couple of hours, but its worth spending at least a day in this geological and historical playground. Enter from the South Gate  tickets cost 30 euros (about 33)  and its easy to be initially underwhelmed. Theres not much to see right away apart from a few toppled ancient columns, which are a frequent sight around this part of Turkey. In truth, the site of Hierapolis and Pamukkale is huge, so it takes a while to reach the good stuff (golf carts can be rented for those really pressed for time or unable to walk the distances here). But it also means that the big reveal, when it comes, is even better. After 10 minutes of strolling along paved pathways from the gate, the line of trees that marks the edge of the plateau comes into sight. Even if you know whats coming, theres still a wow factor when you finally reach it, and the spectacle of that white landscape is revealed. Over millennia, the calcite deposited by the thermal water sputtering out of the ground has reshaped this hillside, creating white terraces that give the area its name  Pamukkale means cotton castle in Turkish. These terraces once held myriad naturally formed blue pools. Most of these are now empty of water and off-limits, leading to some complaints that the site no longer lives up to photographs that show it in years gone by. It is pretty, but theres not as much water as Id expected, says Mary Huang, a tourist from Guangzhou in southern China, posing for a photograph on the edge of one of the pools. The view is gorgeous though. The ancient monastery hanging from the side of a cliff Theres still an impressive series of serene pools, which cascade down the hill. Its a fun spot for paddling or lying down in shallow waters and mud said to have therapeutic properties. To explore the terraces, visitors need to remove their footwear. The rock is uncomfortable and slippery in places, but it doesnt take long to reach the first in the series of pools where toes sink into soft sediment. The top terraces are the busiest, but for those willing to make their way farther down, theres every chance of grabbing a pool to themselves. DJ Tiz, a South Korean music producer on a road trip across Turkey with his partner, singer Fre Naz, is among those slapping mud all over, under the watchful eye of an amicable dog. Having already sampled plenty of the countrys stunning landscapes, he declares: I love Pamukkale the best. For a more complete spa experience, theres the Antique Pool, about five minutes walk from the top of the terraces. Here, for a small extra fee, visitors can use changing rooms and bathe and swim in crystal clear thermal waters over the toppled ruins of an ancient temple to Apollo. Better still, as you near the source of the water, in one corner of the pool, it becomes filled with tiny, fizzing bubbles  its like swimming in warm Champagne or soda. The water is said to offer relief to skin, cardiovascular and rheumatic complaints. Drinking from a water pump here is also said to work for digestive conditions. Paradise Bay: The new destination for an A-list getaway You can spend hours wandering around the remains of Hierapolis  high spots include the wide 2nd century agora marketplace, the magnificent Roman theater and the tombs of the necropolis. The size of the site reveals the citys one-time power and popularity (it even rates a namecheck in the Bible alongside another nearby ruined city, Laodicea, which is also worth a visit). Much of Hierapolis status was derived from the geothermal forces lurking beneath its surface. While many of the Romans and Greeks who came to the city were undoubtedly here for the warm waters, the place had great religious significance as the site of a Plutonium cave, or entrance to Hell. Here, much to the amazement of onlookers, sacrificial animals such as bulls would drop dead after breathing in noxious carbon dioxide fumes swirling up from below. The priests, who led them in would emerge unscathed, having learned to hold their breath. Today, the Plutonium  located between the Ancient Pool and the Roman theater  is another high point on the tour of Hierapolis, and one of many places in the city worth visiting in the cooler evenings when, after nightfall, some attractions are dramatically illuminated. While Pamukkale is enjoying more modern fame thanks to its photogenic appearance in social media posts, some locals lament the changing nature of tourism to the area. Hagia Sophia: Secrets of the 1,600-year-old megastructure that has survived the collapse of empires Ali Durmuş, who runs Pamukkale-based tour company Turkey Magic Travel, says the roping off of much of the travertines and diversion of water since it became a UNESCO World Heritage site has robbed visitors of an experience enjoyed for millennia. He says it puts them off staying longer. Pammukales UNESCO listing led to on-site hotels being demolished, new pools constructed, water redirected down manmade channels, improved site management and closure of the slopes to reverse degradation that had changed them from white to gray. If they cannot enjoy the water, then they are not staying long. Maybe one night or just visiting for an afternoon, Durmuş says. He worries that the diminished experience has meant people miss out on exploring the surrounding area, which has other geothermal attractions. Towns stretching out northwest from Pamukkale along a geological fault line tap into increasingly hotter supplies of steam and water surging up from underground. About 20 minutes drive northwest up the surrounding Denizli Basin, the town of Karahayit has spas and heating systems based around the iron-rich red waters that emerge at around 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). The town also has a lovely covered market, with street vendors selling delicious local mulberry juice. Farther away, in Buharkent  its name meaning steam city  water at boiling point powers what was Turkeys first geothermal power station. In winter, it has been known to sometimes get chilly enough to snow in Pamukkale, but thanks to the primal forces that thrust up from its hellish subterranean portals and paint the hillsides white, its always a hot destination.

        "title": "Trump-appointed Comey prosecutor repeatedly warned against political prosecutions — now she’s accused of leading one",
        "content": "Lindsey Halligan, the US attorney overseeing the prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey, once warned that the Department of Justice risked becoming a tool for political revenge. Today, Halligan is drawing criticism for leading one of the most politically charged prosecutions in decades. Last week, Halligan brought charges against Comey for allegedly lying under oath to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. The grand jury indictment came less than a week after President Donald Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political rivals  specifically naming Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff, and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Theyre all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done, Trump said in a Truth Social post. But Halligans own record and the circumstances around her appointment raise questions about the true motivations at play. The case revives a long-running feud between Trump and Comey, who as FBI director helped lead the investigation into Trumps campaign ties to Russia before Trump fired him in May 2017. A White House aide who previously worked on Trumps legal team, Halligan has never been a prosecutor . But as a former member of Trumps legal team, she has a long record of speaking out against the threat of politically motivated prosecutions. CNNs KFile reviewed dozens of Halligans media appearances, in which she blasted the justice system as corrupt over its investigations into Trump for hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and likened probes into him to election interference. In the interviews Halligan described what she said was a lack of transparency by the FBI after its August 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago, where agents discovered 33 boxes, some filled with classified documents, as the first step to tyranny. In its June 2023 indictment of Trump, the Department of Justice charged Trump with violating the Espionage Act . Halligan warned that prosecuting political figures would unravel the legal system and accused New York City of running a show trial against Trump, referencing the case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, in which Trump was convicted in May 2024 on 34 felony charges of falsifying business records related to hush money payments. Its up to the sitting president to ensure that our criminal system does not unravel into retaliatory or political prosecutions of former presidents and other government officials, Halligan told Fox News in August 2022, referring to then-President Joe Biden after the FBI raid on Trumps Mar-a-Lago estate. Just imagine what if it is now protocol for a new president of the United States to prosecute his or her predecessor. A Department of Justice spokesperson official told CNN, No one is above the law. This Department of Justice will continue to follow the facts and hold those who abuse positions of power accountable. And a person familiar Halligans decision to charge Comey told CNN the case was not political and was based on facts and evidence, including new material that the person said previous prosecutors had not seen. The person added that Halligan would not have proceeded if the case lacked merit, and that she worked closely with the FBI to bring the case. The person also argued that Halligan did not try to make a show of Comeys indictment, saying she decided not to do a perp walk, raid, arrest, TV appearances, interviews or any spectacle  and said there was no special treatment either way. The person argued that efforts to frame the case as political were misplaced, criticized media speculation as uninformed, and said that the full picture would come out eventually in court. But the circumstances of the Comeys grandy jury indictment differ sharply from the cases against Trump. Those indictments were led by a special counsel, not a Biden-appointed US attorney. By comparison, the case against Comey is being brought by a Trump loyalist who was installed after her predecessor declined to bring charges. Though Biden occasionally commented on investigations in ways critics said broke with DOJ norms , as president he consistently stressed DOJ independence, a sharp difference from Trump publicly calling for prosecutions of his political adversaries. Halligan, a former Florida insurance attorney, now leads one of the most powerful US attorneys offices in the country. And in one of her first major actions as interim leader, she indicted one of Trumps political foes  a move that stands in stark contrast to her past rhetoric. In August 2022, Halligan told Fox News that Americans across the political spectrum opposed an overreaching Justice Department and out of control Biden administration after the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago. Well, if were thinking about the future, Id like to just say that the Biden administration has united Americans against its administration. This incident has ironically created bipartisanship on this issue, because no American, whether Democrat or Republican, wants an overreaching Department of Justice. The government seems to be out of control. Its plagued with manipulation, corruption, greed, deceit and fraud, she added. Halligans influence extends beyond her appointment as a US attorney and time as Trumps personal lawyer. After joining the Trump administration in January as a staff secretary, she was soon tasked with reshaping one of the nations most venerable cultural institutions, The Smithsonian. In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order , Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History, that explicitly named Halligan in the text. The order directed her, in consultation with Vice President JD Vance, to monitor Smithsonian museums, research centers, and the National Zoo and to seek to remove improper ideology from their exhibits and programs. In an August radio interview , Halligan complained that the National Museum of American History covered American colonization, saying what you see is all negativity, instead of featuring exhibits that celebrate Black athletes and musician Stevie Wonder. You dont see any exhibit celebrating any people like Michael Jordan, Stevie Wonder, Tiger Woods, Venus or Serena Williams, said Halligan And its bizarre. Instead what you see is all negativity. Comments about colonization. Really just a hatred for our country, and we need to start celebrating greatness again. Right now when you walk in the museums and you walk out, you feel a sense of disgrace for our country, she added. You feel depressed, you feel uncomfortable, and thats not what our federal institution should do. We should be inspiring Americans. Halligan said the attempts to force changes to the institutions were not about whitewashing but appreciating Americas full history. When I moved to DC for this job, I went to the Smithsonian and I saw a lot of just politically charged and ideologically based narratives that have no place in a federal institution thats over 70 funded by taxpayers, she said. I know were getting accused of whitewashing, but its actually not whitewashing at all. Its all about context. So we want to give the full context, the full accuracy of the picture, of all of our colored history, but also not demean America as a whole. And I think all museum curators should really be focused on what inspires a child when they walk through a museum, she added. What inspires an adult? Is it seeing Michael Jordan, who was cut from his high school basketball team, but then goes on to be the best basketball player ever? Even Elon Musk, who was a South African immigrant who has changed the whole landscape of energy, cars and space.",

        "content": "Amazon plans to lay off as many as 30,000 corporate employees, beginning tomorrow, reports say. The cuts would total nearly 10 of the companys corporate jobs, as advances in artificial intelligence stoke fears about the white-collar workforce and the US labor market shows signs of weakening. Reuters was the first to report the job cuts. CNN has reached out to Amazon for comment. Amazon has over 350,000 corporate employees, according to a 2024 survey filed to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a blog post to employees that efficiency gains from artificial intelligence would allow the company to eventually have a reduced human workforce. Its not the first round of massive layoffs for the tech giant. In 2023, the company cut 27,000 workers in its human resources department, Amazon Stores, Amazon Web Services and other divisions. At the time, Jassy attributed the job cuts to a worsening global economic outlook. The cuts come as the US job market has showed warning signs for months, especially for young tech workers . There have been widespread concerns that generative AI could eventually replace many human workers as companies cut costs through greater automation. However, AI experts say a lot of these fears arent backed by substantial research.",

        "title": "OpenAI says over a million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide weekly",
        "content": "OpenAI released new data on Monday illustrating how many of ChatGPTs users are struggling with mental health issues and talking to the AI chatbot about it. The company says that 0.15 of ChatGPTs active users in a given week have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent. Given that ChatGPT has more than 800 million weekly active users, that translates to more than a million people a week. The company says a similar percentage of users show heightened levels of emotional attachment to ChatGPT, and that hundreds of thousands of people show signs of psychosis or mania in their weekly conversations with the AI chatbot. OpenAI says these types of conversations in ChatGPT are extremely rare, and thus difficult to measure. That said, the company estimates these issues affect hundreds of thousands of people every week. OpenAI shared the information as part of a broader announcement about its recent efforts to improve how models respond to users with mental health issues. The company claims its latest work on ChatGPT involved consulting with more than 170 mental health experts. OpenAI says these clinicians observed that the latest version of ChatGPT responds more appropriately and consistently than earlier versions. In recent months, several stories have shed light on how AI chatbots can adversely affect users struggling with mental health challenges. Researchers have previously found that AI chatbots can lead some users down delusional rabbit holes , largely by reinforcing dangerous beliefs through sycophantic behavior. Addressing mental health concerns in ChatGPT is quickly becoming an existential issue for OpenAI. The company is currently being sued by the parents of a 16-year-old boy who confided his suicidal thoughts to ChatGPT in the weeks leading up to his suicide. State attorneys general from California and Delaware  which could block the companys planned restructuring  have also warned OpenAI that it needs to protect young people who use their products. Earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed in a post on X that the company has been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues in ChatGPT, though he did not provide specifics. The data shared on Monday appears to be evidence for that claim, though it raises broader issues about how widespread the problem is. Nevertheless, Altman said OpenAI would be relaxing some restrictions, even allowing adult users to start having erotic conversations with the AI chatbot. In the Monday announcement, OpenAI claims the recently updated version of GPT-5 responds with desirable responses to mental health issues roughly 65 more than the previous version. On an evaluation testing AI responses around suicidal conversations, OpenAI says its new GPT-5 model is 91 compliant with the companys desired behaviors, compared to 77 for the previous GPT5 model. The company also says its latest version of GPT-5 also holds up to OpenAIs safeguards better in long conversations. OpenAI has previously flagged that its safeguards were less effective in long conversations. On top of these efforts, OpenAI says its adding new evaluations to measure some of the most serious mental health challenges facing ChatGPT users. The company says its baseline safety testing for AI models will now include benchmarks for emotional reliance and non-suicidal mental health emergencies. OpenAI has also recently rolled out more controls for parents of children who use ChatGPT. The company says its building an age prediction system to automatically detect children using ChatGPT, and impose a stricter set of safeguards.

        "title": "Amazon identifies the issue that broke much of the internet, says AWS is back to normal",
        "content": "An outage on Monday affected web hosting giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), which took out vast swathes of the web, including websites, banks, and some government services. On Monday afternoon, the company offered an update on the cause of the issue and said it was working to restore services. At 6:01 p.m. ET, Amazon said all AWS services had returned to normal operations. In an announcement on the Amazon website, the company shared that the underlying issue was related to DNS resolution. DNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that converts web addresses into IP addresses so that customer apps and websites can load. While some glitches can be resolved quickly, DNS issues can sometimes take longer to resolve. AWS reported increased error rates for multiple services and determined that the issue was related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoints in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region, the announcement stated. The underlying DNS issue was fully mitigated at 2:24 AM PDT. Though the issue itself was fixed, Amazon needed more time to fully restore service, which it said it was doing as quickly as possible. The company also said that the issue affected Amazon.com and its subsidiaries, as well as AWS customer support operations. Amazon said on Monday evening Eastern time that the outage had been fully mitigated and that most services are returning to normal after an hours-long stretch during which much of the internet could not load. Several major apps were not working. Coinbase , Fortnite , Signal , Perplexity , Venmo , and Zoom faced lengthy outages, as did Amazons own services , including its Ring video surveillance products . The outage even disrupted Eight Sleeps cooling pods, disturbing the sleep of users . Millions of companies and organizations rely on AWS to host their websites, apps, and other critical online systems. The company has data centers all over the world, and Amazon is said to have at least 30 of the total cloud market. Before this, the most recent global internet outage was in 2024, when cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike published a buggy update to its anti-malware engine, causing millions of computers around the world to crash and resulting in airport delays and mass outages. Systems globally took several days to return to normal. Prior to that, a malfunction at DNS provider Akamai in 2021 caused some of the worlds largest websites to drop off the internet for several hours, including FedEx, Steam, and the PlayStation Network. Amazon advised customers to refer to the AWS Health Dashboard for more detailed information on the outage and how it was being resolved.",

        "title": "Instagram users can now use Meta AI editing tools directly in IG Stories",
        "content": "Meta is bringing its AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly to Instagram Stories, allowing users to enter text prompts to add or remove things in photos and videos or even change things completely. While Meta has already offered image editing capabilities on Instagram, those tools were limited to interactions with the Meta AI chatbot. The addition of text-based prompts in Stories now makes these editing features much more accessible. The new features can be found in the Restyle menu located at the top of Instagram Stories when tapping the paintbrush icon. To edit an image, choose add, remove, or change to describe what you want to change in the prompt bar. For instance, Meta explains you can ask it to change your hair color, add a crown to your head, or insert a sunset background. There are also preset effects you can choose from that can alter your outfit or change the images style. For example, you can add items like sunglasses or a biker jacket, and you can also apply a watercolor effect to the image. For videos, you can make it look like its snowing or add flames. Its important to note that when youre using Meta AI on Instagram, youre accepting Metas AI Terms of Service , which allow your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. According to these terms, when you upload your photos, Meta can summarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image. Meta continues to introduce AI updates to remain competitive in the market. It was most recently spotted testing a Write with Meta AI prompt that helps Instagram users come up with clever comments for posts. Last month, the company launched a new AI-generated video feed called  Vibes  in the Meta AI app, likely boosting downloads. New data from Similarweb shows that the apps daily active users on iOS and Android increased to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from about 775,000 four weeks ago. Additionally, to address any concerns parents may have, Meta announced earlier this month that it is introducing new parental control features that enable parents to disable chats with AI characters and monitor the topics their teenagers are discussing with the Meta AI chatbot.",

        "title": "Rivian will pay $250M to settle lawsuit over R1 price hike",
        "content": "Rivian has agreed to pay 250 million to settle a class action shareholder lawsuit filed after the company suddenly hiked prices on its R1 pickup truck and SUV in 2022. The lawsuit alleged Rivian had included misleading statements and figures in regulatory filings in the run-up to its 2021 IPO about the costs required to build the R1 EVs. Despite agreeing to the payment, Rivian said in a press release that it denies the allegations in the suit and maintains that this agreement to settle is not an admission of fault or wrongdoing. The payment still has to be approved by a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. If that happens, Rivian plans to pay 67 million of the total settlement through its directors and officers liability insurance, and the remaining 183 million out of its cash reserves. The company had 4.8 billion in cash (and equivalents) as of June 30 . The settlement comes at a pivotal time for Rivian. The company is deep in preparations to launch its second-generation EV, the R2 SUV, in 2026. That vehicle is much cheaper than the R1 lineup  and Rivian plans to make far more of them. The company says it can build as many as 150,000 per year at its factory in Illinois, and its also building a new factory in Georgia that will produce the R2 and future vehicles. At the same time, R1 sales have been lagging. The company expects to finish 2025 having shipped far fewer EVs than it did in 2024 or 2023. A combination of President Trumps tariffs and the loss of the federal EV tax credit has further complicated the market for Rivians vehicles. To that end, this week the company laid off more than 600 employees in a restructuring that also saw CEO RJ Scaringe take over as interim chief marketing officer . Rivian delivered the first R1 pickup trucks in late 2021. In March 2022, the company decided to hike the price of the truck and the SUV by nearly 20 , citing supply chain shortages, inflation, and plans to introduce cheaper models. (Rivian began R1S SUV deliveries in August 2022.) The company applied the price hike to both new orders and to those who had placed preorders and were on a waitlist. Customers and fans of the company were irate, and Rivian quickly reversed the decision for customers with preorders . Crucially, the price hike announcement also sank Rivians stock price, causing losses for shareholders. It was wrong and we broke your trust in Rivian, Scaringe wrote in a letter at the time. I have made a lot of mistakes since starting Rivian more than 12 years ago, but this one has been the most painful. Rivian shareholder Charles Larry Crews sued the company just a few days later, claiming, among other things, that the company had misrepresented the true cost of building the R1 vehicles in its IPO documentation. Those misrepresentations, he argued, led to the price hike announcements negative impact on the stock price. The lawsuit was granted class action status in July 2024.",

        "title": "Glīd is building an autonomous shortcut to move freight from road to rail — catch it at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025",
        "content": "Kevin Damoa came face-to-face with the challenges and dangers of moving freight from road to rail as a 17-year-old U.S. Army enlistee tasked with loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. It was  as the mechanical engineer and founder of Glīd Technologies puts it  the beginning of his love story with logistics. Its a love story that persisted through a 13-year stint with the U.S. Air Force National Guard as a firefighter to his roles in the private sector at SpaceX, Northrup Grumman, Romeo Power Tech, and Xos Trucks  to name a few. But it wasnt until 2022, while working on the Harley-Davidson e-bike brand spinoff Serial 1, that Damoa circled back to the road-to-rail problem. I had my come-to-Jesus moment, Damoa recalled of the pivotal moment when he decided to strike out on his own. I looked around the globe, and I was like, OK, rail is broken, ports are really congested, roads are congested, the fatalities on roads are crazy. Why arent more folks using rail? And then, my 17-year-old self tapped me on the shoulder, was like, Because its hard to get things from road to rail. Damoa pinpointed the problem: the complex, multi-step process moving a container from a ship to a freight train. He founded Glīd Technologies to try and solve it. The California-based startup (pronounced Glide) is among the 20 Startup Battlefield finalists competing at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 . Glīd isnt trying to compete with trains. Instead, the company is focused on that first mile from port to railroad, as well as road-to-rail applications within large industrial parks. The first mile is where all your problems happen, he said. This is where you unload ships and stack up your containers and then figure out where theyre intended to go to. That process is still broken and involves a bunch of steps. Once a ship arrives at port, a crane picks up a container and loads it onto a hostler truck, a vehicle used to maneuver short distances, where its then driven to a tall stack. A forklift picks up the container and moves it into the stack. Later, a forklift is used to load it back onto a hostler truck, which then drives over to the railroad. A forklift or crane is then used to pick up the container and load it on a freight train, where it waits. Glīd has developed several hardware and software products to speed up and reduce the cost of getting shipping containers to the railhead and eventually their destination. Its first is GliderM, a hybrid-electric vehicle with a hook on the back that can pick up and move 20-foot containers directly to the rail without the need for forklifts of hostler trucks. The startup is also developing logistics software and an armored, low-profile platform called the Rāden that can slide under any trailer, lift it, and move autonomously along the road to rail. You can look at us as the baton racer, he said, describing the system. We hand that load off to the next to the middle mile; the name of the game is utilization  you know, how many containers can we get within that first mile, within a day, in order to maximize or optimize our costs. And the cost structure is compelling. By cutting out forklifts and hostler trucks and using the railroad instead of semi trucks for delivery, Damoa said he is able to offer the companys mobility-as-a-service system at a fraction of the cost. Customers are charged a300,000 subscription a year, which gives them access to a GliderM or Rāden and their logistics software called EZRA-1SIX. Customers are also charged 8 cents per ton per mile. Damoa said thats a deal since companies are getting a train, truck, and a forklift all in one, plus the service. By comparison, the per ton per mile cost today  if the transloading, train, and truck fees are included  is about 2.27, according to Damoa. The 14-person startup is focused on short rail systems, ports that own the track, and industrial parks. Glīd has already signed deals with four short-line railroads as well as the Port of Woodland in Washington, Taylor Transport out of Vancouver, and Great Plains Industrial Park, a 6,800-acre site in Kansas with 30 miles of internal rail lines and an onsite transload facility. Glīds tech and business model has also resonated with investors who see potential in the tech and business model. Damoa said the first couple of years was hard, noting he couldnt pay a person to invest in Glīd. But once he went through the Antler startup accelerator program , which gave him critical CEO and pitch skills, the startup had more success. Glīd received an investment before building its first prototype. The startup announced in July it raised 3.1 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Outlander VC, with participation from Draper U Ventures, Antler, The Veteran Fund, M1C, and angel investors. It has since raised more, putting its total at 7.1 million with a post-money valuation of 35 million.

        "title": "COI Energy solves a conundrum: Letting businesses sell unused electricity — catch it at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025",
        "content": "When it comes to supplying electricity to large enterprises with multi-building campuses, the allocation system is archaic. Unlike homeowners, who pay for what they actually use, campuses buy a standard monthly capacity. This capacity must, by common-sense necessity, be based on max usage needs. This is true even if the company only consumes such max usage rarely, like a single busy season. That was a situation that bothered the hell out of COI Energy founder and CEO, SaLisa Berrien. After earning her degree in mechanical engineering (and later an MBA), she spent 25 years as an energy engineer at major utility companies like PECO, Con Edison, and Exelon, as well as at a few clean energy startups. Berrien chose this field because, as a child, there were times when her parents couldnt pay their electric bill. We were in the dark a lot. And as a kid, my self-esteem was low, she told TechCrunch. Other kids who knew her situation teased her. So when she got her degree and took a job with an electric company, All my friends were like, Youre crazy. That is a stagnated field. Its a white, male-dominated, older-men field. Why are you doing this? And for me, it was personal, because I knew what it felt like being a kid, she said. Berrien wanted to make electricity more efficient, more affordable, more available so no child ever went without. She worked on customer operations, smart grids, clean energy programs. As an engineer, I would go in and make recommendations on how they could improve the energy performance of their buildings, how they can eliminate bottlenecks on production lines, Berrien said. She learned how to use big data to optimize energy efficiency. But no one was addressing the basic problem: Companies were reserving, and paying for, far more energy than they used. Commercial customers continually asked her why they were being overcharged. I agree, she said. Why cant you just pay on demand for what youre using? Berriens answer resulted in three patents (and counting) and founding COI Energy on that tech, assembling a team that includes building management, energy engineers, and a former energy exec. She hired people skilled in everything from regulation to pricing. COIs solution is a marketplace where enterprises within the same utility company can sell some of their energy allotment when COIs data predicts they wont need it. COI is a Startup Battlefield Top 20 finalist and will be pitching its tech at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 , this week in San Francisco. COI installs a patented energy gateway at every customer site to measure energy usage. It ties into the buildings systems and into SCADA systems. It is hardware-agnostic, meaning it can work with any existing utility or building energy system, Berrien said. After collecting data for a period, the platform predicts how much electricity a company will truly require. We can predict out 90 days, she said. The enterprise can then determine how much of the unused energy it would like to release. COI pays the businesses for that capacity, and buyers on the marketplace pay COI to obtain it. If a customer gives us 100 kilowatts, we will pay them for that 100 kilowatts, and then the buyers would buy that from us. COI is still in its pre-seed stage, having raised 3.5 million from investors like former Talen Energy exec Paul Farr, Morgan Stanley Inclusive and Sustainable Ventures, Kachuwa Impact Fund, Chloe Capital, and some crowdfunding on Republic. The startup is, however, already generating revenue through five pilot customers, all of whom have a minimum of 50 buildings. It is operating in California, Florida, Massachusetts, and New York, and has a waitlist. Plus, Berrien said, COI is in talks to be a solution provider to Switzerland as it enacts a national energy policy where businesses and homes can share capacity, starting in 2026. Moreover  remembering her plight as a little girl  Berriens startup has dedicated 1 of the savings that the businesses earn on the platform to be donated to nonprofit organizations that help the underprivileged with their energy needs. These are organizations that help pay bills, provide weatherization, and offer energy programs like solar. Were paying it forward with what we call Kilowatt for Good, Berrien said. Her goal is to offer tech that helps overwhelmed energy systems now. Instead of wasting capacity, youre sharing it. So were making the planet better. Were making our bottom lines better. And then at the same time, were helping and uplifting our communities, she said.

        "title": "ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot",
        "content": "ChatGPT, OpenAIs text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users. 2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora. OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAIs transition to a for-profit. In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that its ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek . The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history. Below, youll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which weve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here. To see a list of 2024 updates, go here . OpenAI is partnering with Walmart to allow users to browse products, plan meals, and make purchases through ChatGPT, with support for third-party sellers expected later this fall. The partnership is part of OpenAIs broader effort to develop AI-driven e-commerce tools, including collaborations with Etsy and Shopify . OpenAI is expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan , priced under 5, to 16 new countries across Asia, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. In some of these countries, users can pay in local currencies, while in others, payments are required in USD, with final costs varying due to local taxes. ChatGPT now has 800 million weekly active users , reflecting rapid growth across consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments, Sam Altman said. This milestone comes as OpenAI accelerates efforts to expand its AI infrastructure and secure more chips to support rising demand. OpenAI now allows developers to build interactive apps directly inside ChatGPT , with early partners like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva already onboard. The ChatGPT maker is also rolling out a preview of its Apps SDK, a developer toolkit for creating these chat-based experiences. OpenAI is reportedly adding parental controls to ChatGPT on web and mobile, letting parents and teens link accounts to enable safeguards like limiting sensitive content, setting quiet hours, and disabling features such as voice mode or image generation. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny and a lawsuit over the chatbots alleged role in a teens suicide. OpenAI unveiled Pulse, a new ChatGPT feature that delivers personalized morning briefings overnight, encouraging users to start their day with the app. The tool reflects a shift toward making ChatGPT more proactive and asynchronous, positioning it as a true assistant rather than just a chatbot. OpenAIs new Applications CEO, Fidji Simo, called Pulse the first step toward bringing high-level personal support to everyone, starting with Pro users. OpenAI launched Instant Checkout in ChatGPT , letting U.S. users purchase products directly from Etsy and, soon, over a million Shopify merchants without leaving the conversation. Shoppers can browse items, read reviews, and complete purchases with a single tap using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or a credit card. The update marks a step toward reshaping online shopping by merging product discovery, recommendations, and payments in one place. OpenAI rolled out its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go plan in Indonesia for Rp 75,000 (4.50) per month, following its initial launch in India. The mid-tier plan, which offers higher usage limits, image generation, file uploads, and better memory compared to the free version, enters the market in direct competition with Googles new AI Plus plan in Indonesia. CEO Sam Altman announced new policies for under-18 users of ChatGPT, tightening safeguards around sensitive conversations. The company says it will block flirtatious exchanges with minors and add stronger protections around discussions of suicide, even escalating severe cases to parents or authorities. The move comes as OpenAI faces a wrongful death lawsuit tied to alleged chatbot interactions, underscoring rising concerns about the mental health risks of AI companions. OpenAI rolled out GPT-5-Codex , a new version of its AI coding agent that can spend anywhere from a few seconds to seven hours tackling a task, depending on complexity. The company says this dynamic approach helps the model outperform GPT-5 on key coding benchmarks, including bug fixes and large-scale refactoring. The update comes as OpenAI looks to keep Codex competitive in a fast-growing market that now includes rivals like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. OpenAI is shaking up its Model Behavior team , the small but influential group that helps shape how its AI interacts with people. The roughly 14-person team is being folded into the larger Post Training group, now reporting to lead researcher Max Schwarzer. Meanwhile, founding leader Joanne Jang is spinning up a new unit called OAI Labs, focused on prototyping fresh ways for people to collaborate with AI. OpenAI, facing a lawsuit from the parents of a 16-year-old who died by suicide , said in its blog that it has implemented new safeguards for ChatGPT, including stronger detection of mental health risks and parental control features. The AI company said the updates aim to provide tighter protections around suicide-related conversations and give parents more oversight of their childrens use. Elon Musks AI startup, xAI, filed a federal lawsuit in Texas against Apple and OpenAI , alleging that the two companies colluded to lock up key markets and shut out rivals. OpenAI introduced its most affordable subscription plan, ChatGPT Go, in India, priced at 399 rupees per month (approximately 4.57). This move aims to expand OpenAIs presence in its second-largest market, offering enhanced access to the latest GPT-5 model and additional features. Since its May 2023 launch, ChatGPTs mobile app has amassed 2 billion in global consumer spending , dwarfing competitors like Claude, Copilot, and Grok by roughly 30 times, according to Appfigures. This year alone, the app has generated 1.35 billion, a 673 increase from the same period in 2024, averaging nearly 193 million per month, or 53 times more than its nearest rival, Grok. Updates to ChatGPT: You can now choose between Auto, Fast, and Thinking for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people. Rate limits are now 3,000 messagesweek with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reddit users that GPT-5s dumber behavior at launch was due to a router issue and promised fixes, double rate limits for Plus users, and transparency on which model is answering, while also shrugging off the infamous chart crime from the live presentation. OpenAI released GPT-5 , a next-gen AI thats not just smarter but more useful  able to handle tasks like coding apps, managing calendars, and creating research briefs  while automatically figuring out the fastest or most thoughtful way to answer your questions. OpenAI is making a major push into federal government workflows , offering ChatGPT Enterprise to agencies for just 1 for the next year . The move comes after the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) added OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its approved AI vendor list, allowing agencies to access these tools through preset contracts without negotiating pricing. OpenAI unveiled its first open source language models since GPT-2, introducing two new open-weight AI releases: gpt-oss-120b, a high-performance model capable of running on a single Nvidia GPU, and gpt-oss-20b, a lighter model optimized for laptop use. The move comes amid growing competition in the global AI market and a push for more open technology in the U.S. and abroad. ChatGPTs rapid growth is accelerating. OpenAI said the chatbot was on track to hit 700 million weekly active users in the first week of August, up from 500 million at the end of March. Nick Turley, OpenAIs VP and head of the ChatGPT app, highlighted the apps growth on X , noting it has quadrupled in size over the past year. This week, ChatGPT is on track to reach 700M weekly active users  up from 500M at the end of March and 4 since last year. Every day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems. Big week ahead. Grateful to the team for making ChatGPT more useful and ChatGPT users should be cautious when seeking emotional support from AI, as the AI industry lacks safeguards for sensitive conversations, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on a recent episode of This Past Weekend w Theo Von. Unlike human therapists, AI tools arent bound by doctor-patient confidentiality, he noted. ChatGPT now receives 2.5 billion prompts daily from users worldwide, including roughly 330 million from the U.S. Thats more than double the volume reported by CEO Sam Altman just eight months ago, highlighting the chatbots explosive growth. OpenAI has introduced ChatGPT Agent , which completes a wide variety of computer-based tasks on behalf of users and combines several capabilities like Operator and Deep Research , according to the company . OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a users calendar, draft editable presentations and slideshows, run code, shop online, and handle complex workflows from end to end, all within a secure virtual environment. Researchers at Stanford University have observed that therapy chatbots powered by large language models can sometimes stigmatize people with mental health conditions or respond in ways that are inappropriate or could be harmful. While chatbots are being used as companions, confidants, and therapists, the study found significant risks. CEO Sam Altman said that the company is delaying the release of its open model, which had already been postponed by a month earlier this summer. The ChatGPT maker, which initially planned to release the model around mid-July, has indefinitely postponed its launch to conduct additional safety testing. we planned to launch our open-weight model next week. we are delaying it; we need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us. while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are OpenAI plans to release an AI-powered web browser to challenge Alphabets Google Chrome. It will keep some user interactions within ChatGPT, rather than directing people to external websites. Some ChatGPT users have noticed a new feature called Study Together appearing in their list of available tools. This is the chatbots approach to becoming a more effective educational tool, rather than simply providing answers to prompts. Some people also wonder whether there will be a feature that allows multiple users to join the chat, similar to a study group. Referrals from ChatGPT to news publishers are increasing . But this rise is insufficient to offset the decline in clicks as more users now obtain their news directly from AI or AI-powered search results, according to a report by digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Since Google launched its AI Overviews in May 2024, the percentage of news searches that dont lead to clicks on news websites has increased from 56 to nearly 69 by May 2025. OpenAI has started using Googles AI chips to power ChatGPT and other products, as reported by Reuters. The ChatGPT maker is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidias GPUs, using the AI chips to train models, and this is the first time that OpenAI is using non -Nvidia chips in an important way. Researchers from MITs Media Lab monitored the brain activity of writers in 32 regions. They found that ChatGPT users showed minimal brain engagement and consistently fell short in neural, linguistic, and behavioral aspects. To conduct the test, the lab split 54 participants from the Boston area into three groups, each consisting of individuals ages 18 to 39. The participants were asked to write multiple SAT essays using tools such as OpenAIs ChatGPT, the Google search engine, or without any tools. The ChatGPT app for iOS was downloaded 29.6 million times in the last 28 days, while TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and X were downloaded a total of 32.9 million times during the same period, representing a difference of about 10.6, according to ZDNET report citing Similarwebs X post. Sam Altman said that the average ChatGPT query uses about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, equivalent to 0.000083 gallons of water, or the energy required to power a lightbulb for a few minutes, per Business Insider . In addition to that, the chatbot requires 0.34 watt-hours of electricity to operate. OpenAI has unveiled o3-pro , an enhanced version of its o3, a reasoning model that the chatGPT maker launched earlier this year. O3-pro is available for ChatGPT and Team users and in the API, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access in the third week of June. OpenAI o3-pro is available in the model picker for Pro and Team users starting today, replacing OpenAI o1-pro. Enterprise and Edu users will get access the week after. As o3-pro uses the same underlying model as o3, full safety details can be found in the o3 system card. OpenAI upgraded ChatGPTs conversational voice mood for all paid users across different markets and platforms. The startup has launched an update to Advanced Voice that enables users to converse with ChatGPT out loud in a more natural and fluid sound. The feature also helps users translate languages more easily, the comapny said . OpenAIs ChatGPT now offers new funtions for business users , including integrations with various cloud services, meeting recordings, and MCP connection support for connecting to tools for in-depth research. The feature enables ChatGPT to retrieve information across users own services to answer their questions. For instance, an analyst could use the companys slide deck and documents to develop an investment thesis. OpenAI plans to purchase Jony Ives devices startup io for 6.4 billion. Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, thinks that the hardware will significantly enhance ChatGPT and broaden OpenAIs reach to a larger audience in the future. OpenAI has introduced its AI coding agent, Codex, powered by codex-1, a version of its o3 AI reasoning model designed for software engineering tasks. OpenAI says codex-1 generates more precise and cleaner code than o3. The coding agent may take anywhere from one to 30 minutes to complete tasks such as writing simple features, fixing bugs, answering questions about your codebase, and running tests. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said during a recent AI event hosted by VC firm Sequoia that he wants ChatGPT to record and remember every detail of a persons life when one attendee asked about how ChatGPT can become more personalized. OpenAI said in a post on X that it has launched its GPT-4.1 and GPT4.1 mini AI models in ChagGPT. By popular request, GPT-4.1 will be available directly in ChatGPT starting today. GPT-4.1 is a specialized model that excels at coding tasks  instruction following. Because its faster, its a great alternative to OpenAI o3  o4-mini for everyday coding needs. OpenAI has launched a new feature for ChatGPT deep research to analyze code repositories on GitHub. The ChatGPT deep research feature is in beta and lets developers connect with GitHub to ask questions about codebases and engineering documents. The connector will soon be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users, with support for Enterprise and Education coming shortly, per an OpenAI spokesperson. After introducing a data residency program in Europe in February, OpenAI has now launched a similar program in Asian countries including India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea. The new program will be accessible to users of ChatGPT Enterprise, ChatGPT Edu, and API. It will help organizations in Asia meet their local data sovereignty requirements when using OpenAIs products. OpenAI is unveiling a program called OpenAI for Countries , which aims to develop the necessary local infrastructure to serve international AI clients better. The AI startup will work with governments to assist with increasing data center capacity and customizing OpenAIs products to meet specific language and local needs. OpenAI for Countries is part of efforts to support the companys expansion of its AI data center Project Stargate to new locations outside the U.S., per Bloomberg . OpenAI has announced its plan to make changes to its procedures for updating the AI models that power ChatGPT, following an update that caused the platform to become overly sycophantic for many users. OpenAI has released a post on the recent sycophancy issues with the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, leading the company to revert an update to the model released last week. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back . OpenAI is working on additional fixes to the models personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast. OpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search , its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. OpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAIs cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch . OpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAIs VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch. OpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step  sending safety cards for GPT-4.1  claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there wont be a separate system card released for it. Questions have been raised regarding OpenAIs transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25 of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10, which was significantly lower than OpenAIs top-reported score. OpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads. OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini , for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAIs safety report . OpenAI has released two new reasoning models , o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAIs previous models. Open AI introduced a new section called library to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the companys X post . All of your image creations, all in one place. Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creationsrolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https:t.conYW5KO1aIg . pic.twitter.comADWuf5fPbj OpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards. The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition. OpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musks X and Mark Zuckerbergs Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge . It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT. OpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5 , from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAIs API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14. OpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model  GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano  with a specific focus on coding capabilities. Its accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Googles Gemini 2.5 Pro , Anthropics Claude 3.7 Sonnet , and DeepSeeks upgraded V3. OpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4 , an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog . It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAIs API. OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported , citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAIs GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report. OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new ImageGen watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPTs Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: Structured Thoughts, Reasoning Recap, CoT Search Tool, and l1239dk1. OpenAI is offering its 20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May . The offer will let millions of students use OpenAIs premium service, which offers access to the companys GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version. More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap . The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos. The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAIs o3 reasoning model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately 3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around 30,000 per task. In a series of posts on X , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the companys new image-generation tools popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges, he wrote. OpeanAI intends to release its first open language model since GPT-2 in the coming months. The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia. OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images . The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now evolved its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAIs model behavior. OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropics Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said . The latest update of the image generator on OpenAIs ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away. The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to 12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported , citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesnt expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass 29.4 billion, the report said. Brad Lightcap, OpenAIs chief operating officer, will lead the companys global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products , according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer. OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the companys official media channels . The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPTs free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative, a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch . OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information . One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAIs ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAIs models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans. Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate, said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. If its not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isnt enough. You cant just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true. OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs : a text-to-speech model, gpt-4o-mini-tts, that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less. OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 reasoning AI model to deliver consistently better responses. Its only accessible to select developers who have spent at least 5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges 150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and 600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAIs GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1. Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for reasoning could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X , that the company has trained a new model thats really good at creative writing . He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief. OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet howwhen it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right. PROMPT: Please write a metafictional literary short story OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents  automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks  using the companys own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAIs new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAIs Operator product . The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAIs Assistants API , which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026. OpenAI intends to release several agent products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information . One, a high-income knowledge worker agent, will reportedly be priced at 2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost 10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting PhD-level research, are expected to cost 20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly 5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. Its unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAIs AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPTs weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025 . ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that models launch. OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a simplified product offering. In a post on X , Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that integrates a lot of OpenAIs technology, including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAIs latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesnt consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step thought process. ChatGPT users will see an updated chain of thought that shows more of the models reasoning steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbots last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in. OpenAI announced a new AI agent called deep research thats designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the agent is intended for instances where you dont just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI used the subreddit rChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit users mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models responses to human replies for that same post. OpenAI launched a new AI reasoning model, o3-mini, the newest in the companys o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both powerful and affordable. A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPTs mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5 of all users. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAIs corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAIs tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked 1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether theyve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think its acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the companys AI agent tool, for up to 90 days  even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operators. OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator, OpenAIs agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPTs code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the 200 Pro subscription plan. The changes arent yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPTs client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAIs website. ChatGPTs new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders . For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and traits theyd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like Chatty, Encouraging, and Gen Z. However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so its possible they went live prematurely. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI . The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o . There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus . Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questionsconcerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool . Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any softwaresystem that holds dialogue with youa person but doesnt necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that theyll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Due to the nature of how these models work , they dont know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. Thats a problem when youre using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didnt commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users. Its not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it was released March 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it cant necessarily program an entire apps worth of code. Thats because ChatGPT lacks context awareness  in other words, the generated code isnt always appropriate for the specific context in which its being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together , Googles Gemini and Anthropics Claude , and developers are creating open source alternatives . OpenAI has said that individuals in certain jurisdictions (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form . This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression in accordance with applicable laws. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled  OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request . In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on legitimate interest (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out  when it writes: See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models. Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAIs technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPTs false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools , have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with . There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes . Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase . Another is ChatX . More launch every day. Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests , theyre inconsistent at best. No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users conversations to other people on the service. None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data. This story is continually updated with new information.",

        "content": "Waymos co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, had a clear message during her interview on the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 stage Monday: It is imperative that we scale. Mawakana was speaking in the context of how Waymo balances fundraising (and burning through that money) with eventually achieving profitability. But she was also clear in the interview that she believes Waymo can increase road safety by reaching that scale. All this helps explain why the company has been on an expansion tear this year and expects to launch in many more U.S. cities  D.C., Miami, Denver, Dallas, Seattle, and Nashville  as well as in London in 2026. Its a furious pace that has seen the autonomous vehicle company leverage multiple partnerships with companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Avis. By the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week, she said. Mawakana spent a lot of time during the interview with TechCrunch transportation editor Kirsten Korosec talking about the challenges of safely reaching that kind of scale. The Waymo co-CEO maintained that the company is operating at a level that is safer than the typical human driver. And while she didnt name names, she took a shot at competitors, saying they arent doing enough to prove that their autonomous vehicle technology is truly safe . It is incumbent upon them to be transparent about whats happening, she said. And if you are not being transparent, then it is my view that you are not doing what is necessary in order to actually earn the right to make the road safer. Her comments come as the company continues to iron out edge cases during its expansion  with one of the most recent incidents coming in Atlanta, Georgia, where a Waymo vehicle pulled out in front of a stopped school bus, leading to an investigation from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . Waymo itself recently released a report claiming its vehicles are already five times safer than most human drivers, and 12 times safer with respect to pedestrians. Still, Waymo vehicles have been caught making a number of head-scratching decisions. Its important to recognize, its not going to be perfection, but that doesnt mean you shouldnt be accountable for transparency, Mawakana said onstage. I think  we really worry as a company about those days. You know, we dont say whether, we say when, and we plan for them. Mawakana also said Waymo doesnt think in terms of how many incidents are allowable. We know theyre going to happen because our cars are on the road with humans, and unfortunately, right now, the state of the roads and the state of human driving is there is a lot of deaths, and there are a lot of injuries being caused on the roadways, she said. And when asked whether the public would accept a death caused by a robotaxi in the face of the promise of greater safety, Mawakana said: I think that society will.",

        "title": "Sequoia unveils $950M in new early-stage funds as it strives to be ‘only as good as our next investment’",
        "content": "Despite the growing chatter of an AI bubble, Sequoia Capital insists its investment approach is unswayed by the market frenzy. Markets go up and down, but our strategy remains consistent. Were always looking for outlier founders with ideas to build generational businesses, said Bogomil Balkansky, a partner on Sequoias early-stage investment team. To prove this consistency, Sequoia announced two new funds on Monday that nearly match the sizes launched about three years ago: a 750 million early-stage fund targeting Series A startups and a 200 million seed fund. These funds were introduced after what has been a tumultuous period for the legendary firm. In 2021, Sequoia overhauled its structure into an evergreen main fund supported by strategy-specific sub-funds, primarily to enable the firm to retain stock in portfolio companies long after their IPO. The firm took a significant financial hit in late 2022, losing over 200 million when its investment in cryptocurrency exchange FTX blew up, followed by the 2023 separation from its India and China divisions. The storied firm, which famously backed Airbnb, Google, Nvidia, and Stripe in their infancy, is putting recent challenges behind it and returning to its core purpose: investing in promising founders at the earliest stages of creation. Balkansky reinforced this mission: Our ambition has always been and continues to be to identify these founders as early as possible; to roll up our sleeves and be a very active participant in their company-building journey. With AI startup valuations skyrocketing, Sequoia wants to use the new funds to invest in the most promising founders at the beginning of their startup-building journey. This strategy allows the firm to secure a low price while locking in a significant ownership stake. This early-stage focus is even more crucial for the firm now. As valuations soar at an unprecedented pace, getting in early is the key to locking in a lower price and securing a substantial stake. This approach is paying off: Sequoias seed and Series A investments in Clay , Harvey , n8n , Sierra , and Temporal have appreciated manyfold amid the AI boom. Even with its renowned Series A history, Balkansky made it clear that Sequoia aims to defend its legacy by investing even earlier: We have an amazing track record and tradition to partner with companies at the very earliest stage, which today will be classified as a pre-seed. He highlighted the firms early conviction: Sequoia recently wrote the first check into security tester Xbow , AI reliability engineer Traversal , and DeepSeek alternative Reflection AI  all companies that have since raised significant capital at much higher valuations. Among the ways the firm has helped behind the scenes, it says it recruited a former Databricks CRO to Xbows board, connected Traversal with more than 30 potential customers, and arranged a meeting between Reflection AI and Nvidias Jensen Huang, leading directly to a 500 million investment from the chipmaker. Even with these recent successes, Sequoia is relentlessly focused on upholding its five-decade legacy as Silicon Valleys top investor. To ensure this mindset persists, the firms newly renovated office features a wall where every investor handwrote this reminder: We are only as good as our next investment.",

        "title": "Amazon May Lay Off 30,000 Employees After News The Company Plans Mass Automation, Report Says",
        "content": "Amazon is preparing to lay off up to 30,000 corporate workers, Reuters reported Monday, news that comes less than a week after internal strategy documents suggested the company would replace 600,000 workers with robots, artificial intelligence and other automation tools by 2033. Amazon, the second-largest employer in the country, is planning to cut as much as nearly 10 of its corporate workforce to \"compensate for overhiring\" during the pandemic, unnamed sources told Reuters . The news comes less than one week after the New York Times discovered the company has plans to use robots and other automated systems to do the jobs of up to 600,000 employees in the next eight years, rather than add real people to its roster of 1.55 million employees. The corporate layoffs could represent one of the largest job cuts in company history, potentially surpassing the axing of 27,000 jobs in 2022. A representative for Amazon said they could not comment on the Reuters report. Despite reported plans to eliminate jobs higher up, Amazon has said it plans to hire the same number of seasonal employees it always does: 250,000 across full- and part-time positions during the end-of-year shopping season. Overall, American employers are planning to hire a record-low number of seasonal employees in the final months of the year. If 30,000 people lose their jobs, the cut at Amazon will rank among the largest corporate job cuts in American history, almost equal with the 31,000 jobs eliminated by Boeing in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. The Boeing mass layoff is the 10th- biggest in history. It's been a big year for layoffs. By the end of July, job cuts at U.S.-based companies had already surpassed all of 2024 and, though September, employers had announced almost 1 million job cuts, more than any year since the pandemic hit in 2020, according to career services firm Challenger, Gray  Christmas. Andy Challenger, the firm's senior vice president, said the job cuts can be largely blamed on a stagnating labor market, cost increases and \"transformative new technology,\" like AI. Technological updates, including automation, are responsible for 20,000 job cuts so far this year and another 17,375 cuts have been explicitly attributed to AI. The government has laid off more employees than any other sector, followed by tech companies, which have cut more than 100,000 jobs in 2025. Jeff Bezos , the founder of Amazon, is the fourth-richest man in the world as of Monday with a net worth of 238.7. billion. Amazon is ranked No. 5 on Forbes' list of the largest public companies in the world, with a market value of 2 trillion. CORRECTION (1027): This story has been updated to note Amazon reportedly plans to rely on automation to eliminate the need to hire for up to 600,000 roles in the future.",

        "content": "Innovation, experimentation and change are the only constants in the search for the next big thing. This is especially true with the emergence of new technologies like artificial intelligence. Since the launch of mainstream AI platforms like ChatGPT came to the forefront in 2022, the consumer world has been abuzz with the possibilities AI can offer. But for many startup founders, the usage of this new tech goes far beyond a 3-year-old chatbot. Instead, theyre powering sustainable energy solutions, automating the supply chain and making healthcare more accessible. Todays 30 Under 30 alumni are proof that AI is unleashing creativity and reshaping the ways we work, build and make money. To highlight the power of these new technologies, editors pulled together a list of four tech-powered startups pushing the limits of innovation to help them scale. Up first: Janet Ho, 2025 Under 30 AI lister and chief operating officer of Hume AI. Hume is generating speech-language models to create realistic voices that can understand and convey emotion  so developers can create chatbots that speak to their users as a person would. Its current customers include developers working in healthcare, customer service and edtech. Hume AI raised over 50 million in Series B funding last year from investors including EQT, USV, Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross. The company launched Octave 2 this month, the second generation of its AI voice model for text-to-speech. Half the price of its first generation, Octave 2 speaks 11 languages, is 40 faster and has a deeper understanding of tone, propelling the conversation about AI forward  literally. While Hume focuses on the virtual world, AI is being used to make higher quality, climate friendly and less expensive physical products, too. Take Vizcom, a 2025 honoree of the Manufacturing  Industry list founded by Jordan Taylor and Kaelan Richards. Vizcom enables designers and manufacturers to turn an idea from a sketch into a 3D design in minutes. Vizcom is a software fitted with AI tools that allows users to make changes to product sketches (like changing the material, texture or color) in seconds to create new concepts as fast as they can draw. In July, Vizcom rolled out a new feature called Modify  allowing users to instruct their vision for a product in a more visual way. Instead of turning back to the drawing board or thinking up new prompts to input, designers can make adjustments to their designs with more intuitive toggles or sliders to direct their ideas with ease. Vizcom customers include major brands like Ford and New Balance. AI wont replace creativity, it will amplify it, and that makes the possibilities limitless, says Taylor. For Julia Dixon, 2025 30 Under 30 Education lister, using AI to promote creativity is exactly what her company, ESAI, is all about. ESAI is an edutech platform that acts like a highschoolers personalized college admissions tutor, helping with everything from coming up with ideas for admissions essays to sourcing their dream internship. ESAI doesnt do the work for students, but instead guides them just as a human tutor would, to ensure that the work they do is entirely their own. The platform is used by over half a million students across the country. While AI is arguably starting to displace some hard skills like data entry and coding, Dixon says technology can never replace the things that make us unique. With this vision, she appeared on pitch competition show Shark Tank earlier this year and impressed investor Mark Cuban, resulting in a 250,000 investment at 5 equity, with an additional 2.5 in advisory shares. Were entering a moment where AI will replace many of the hard skills we once thought were differentiators, Dixon says. What it cant replace, and what can never be outsourced, is your story: who you are, how you think and the connections you make. New technology is also driving innovation across medicine. Medical device company StrokeDx, founded by 2025 Science listers Alexander Ballatori and Shane Shahrestani, can diagnose stroke type in minutes instead of hours with its STEDI device. The portable, inpatient, automated imaging device can generate small magnetic fields, enabling its sensor to work like a metal detector and find blood flow irregularities in the brain. Being under 30 has given us both the willingness to challenge entrenched healthcare systems and the agility to innovate quickly, Shahrestani says. For these young founders, the fast pace of evolving technology offers endless opportunities to try new things, even when it means pushing back against convention. AI-powered platforms, speech-language models, personalized tutors and life-saving medical devices are only the beginnings of the next wave of technological invention. Ive grown up in a world where tools are constantly evolving, and Ive never felt tied to the way things have always been done, Taylor says. That mindset drives a willingness to experiment, move fast and challenge conventions.",

        "content": "Billionaire Trump megadonor Timothy Mellon is the benefactor who gave 130 million to help the federal government pay military members during the shutdown, The New York Times reported Saturday, citing two anonymous sources. The Pentagon said Friday it had accepted the money to help ensure the military doesnt miss a paycheck during the government shutdown. Trump first revealed Thursday a friend, provided the donation, but said the person wanted to remain anonymous, telling reporters Friday he doesnt want publicity. Forbes has reached out to Mellon for comment. The New York Times reported Mellon and his representatives could not be reached for comment. The Pentagon accepted the donation under its general gift acceptance authority, though some lawmakers and experts have questioned its legality under the Antideficiency Act, which prevents the federal government from spending money that hasnt been appropriated by Congress. We estimate the Mellon family is worth 14.1 billion. Forbes estimated in July last year Mellons individual net worth is close to 1 billion, though he denied he is a billionaire in an email to Forbes at the time, writing never have been, never will be. 50 million. Thats how much Mellon donated to the pro-Trump super PAC, Make America Great Again Inc., in June last year, one of the largest single political donations ever recorded. He spent more than 165 million in the 2024 election cycle supporting Republicans, including a 25 million donation to Trump, according to OpenSecrets. Mellon is the heir to the Mellon family banking fortune and railroad magnate in his own right. Mellon, 83, is a reclusive figure who spends most of his time at his ranch in Wyoming, he told Bloomberg in a rare interview in 2020. Great-grandson of banker Thomas Mellon and grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, he made his first major political donation10 millionto a GOP super PAC in 2018, and donated 50 million to Trump in May last year, the day after Trumps hush money conviction in New York.

        "title": "Coloring your AWS accounts (at scale!) 🌈",
        "content": "Back in August AWS announced a new feature that allows you to label your AWS accounts with a color that shows up when you're using the AWS Console. This is a tiny, but very welcome quality of life improvement that gives you a visual indicator of what type of account you're using (e.g.,  for dev and  for prod ) - reducing the chance of production accidents and giving each account a bit more pizzazz. The feature came with API support on launch (yay!), but without CloudFormation and, somewhat surprisingly, any SDK support 1 . So most people will probably end up manually configuring this through the AWS Console anyway (boo!).. But where there's a will an endpoint there's a way. In this article I'll use the account coloring feature as a practical example to demonstrate different approaches to programmatic infrastructure provisioning across AWS accounts. Even if you're not interested in account colors, you might pick up a useful thing or two along the way. curl has for some time supported signing requests using AWS SigV4, so the most lo-fi, programmatic way to set the color for an account is something like this: If you're using AWS Identity Center for managing access to your accounts, you can run the above command like this to spin up a subshell with credentials exposed through the expected environment variables: This works, but is not very IaC-y. Can we do better? Since there's no CloudFormation support yet we'll need to create a Lambda-backed custom resource to fill in the gap. And since there's no SDK support either, we'll have to perform the request ourselves. Luckily we can leverage a lower-level module in botocore to help sign our request. For our custom resource we'll also be using the ServiceTimeout property introduced in 2024 to give us a saner developer experience, especially during development (goodbye 1-hour feedback loops - you won't be missed ). Bringing it all together, we get the following CloudFormation template: Let's store this template in cfn-templatesaccount-color.yml . Cool. Now we have a template we can easily deploy using the AWS CLI to set the color for an account: This works well for one account, but what about a handful? And what if we want to use a different color for each account? Let's bring in the lingua franca of the cloud: Bash. If we have a naming convention for our AWS CLI profiles, we could do something like this to provision our template across accounts: This is decent, but still not ideal. How do we manage permissions to all of these accounts? Where do we run this? How do we handle parallelism and errors? If only there was an AWS-native mechanism for managing infrastructure across accounts at scale.. I've written about CloudFormation StackSets before, and I think it's a useful and powerful tool, especially for managing baseline infrastructure across accounts and regions. As I mentioned in that post: If you need to deploy across AWS organizations, want to have granular control over which accounts are deployed to, or you think youll need account-specific parameter values in your stacks, you probably want to go with the self-managed model! Since colors are more likely to be specific per account, not per Organizational Unit (OU), the self-managed permission model is probably the way to go here because it allows us to set different values of the Color parameter per account 2 . The main drawback of the self-managed permission model is - as the name implies - that you need to manage the permissions. This includes setting up an IAM role (the \"administration role\") in the StackSet administration account, and an IAM role (the \"execution role\") in each target account that you want StackSets to deploy to. Below is an example of how to provision our CloudFormation template and set the color for an account using CloudFormation StackSets. Here we're using Terraform to manage the stack set itself, but it should be fairly straight-forward to adapt this to your IaC tool of choice. To make it easy to try out yourself, everything is isolated to one AWS account - we use the current account as both the stack set administrator and the target account. While you normally wouldn't use StackSets like this (instead you'd just create the CloudFormation stack directly), it demonstrates the important bits and allows you to test in a non-critical account. Note: We will be attaching the AdministratorAccess managed policy to the execution role in the following examples. While you could attempt to scope this down to only the specific permissions needed, doing so for a service like CloudFormation StackSets can be impractical - overly restrictive permissions can lead to deployment failures and debugging headaches. But at the very least, consider the implications of this before production use. Store this in a file main.tf alongside your cfn-templates directory, authenticate to AWS in an experimental account, and run terraform init and terraform apply . For provisioning across accounts we can adapt the example from my previous blog post that shows us how to create a service-managed stack set that auto-deploys an IAM role to all accounts in an organization. We can leverage this pattern to easily and automatically create an execution role in all target accounts. Our final code snippet will create two stack sets: Note that in order to use service-managed stack sets you need to: The resulting Terraform code can look something like this: You can try it out by storing the snippet above in a file main.tf , fixing the TODO s, running it against a non-critical OU , and verifying that the Terraform plan looks good. There you have it, folks. Colored AWS accounts. We're truly living in the future. While I do expect that we'll get both SDK and CloudFormation support in the near-ish future (and if we're lucky the possibility to configure this centrally from the management account), you can still get started with the CloudFormation approach laid out here. Once something better and more native shows up, you should be able to delete the custom resource and associated resources without issues and replace it with a new mechanism - the custom resource is configured to be a no-op on deletion. Note that managed policies typically used for read access (e.g., ViewOnlyAccess and ReadOnlyAccess ) do not yet include permissions to fetch the color of an account. If you're using these and want your developers to experience the cloud in all its colorful glory, consider adding uxc:GetAccountColor to the relevant IAM roles. What we've done here might seem a teeny-tiny tad overkill for this specific use case, but the overall approach and the patterns described can be applied when provisioning any baseline infrastructure across accounts. \" It is something that would need to be implemented by the service team \" If you really wanted to use a service-managed stack set instead of a self-managed one you could do so by updating the custom resource to determine the color (e.g., by looking up account name or alias, and introducing some rules for mapping to colors). Generally speaking I favor more explicit behavior than this though.",

        "title": "How I Built a Curated, Automated Open Source Portfolio",
        "content": "I've been on a continuous journey in open source since 2020. First, as a contributor, and for the last few years, also as a project maintainer. It's a space where I've learned so much and given back what I can. I've always wanted a way to track my progress and showcase my contributions in a portfolio. It's not just about highlighting achievements; it's about monitoring growth, celebrating milestones, and having a resource to share with potential collaborators or employers. For a long time, this was a manual, frustrating task. My first attempts at tracking were old-school. I tried maintaining a Google Sheet, logging every merged Pull Request (PR), every issue I opened, and every valuable code review. Then I tried creating a dedicated GitHub repository, where I'd manually add Markdown files for each contribution. You can probably guess how this story goes. Yes, life got in the way, and I became busy with other tasks. Suddenly, a few days turned into a few weeks, and before I knew it, my tracker was totally outdated. It just became stale and useless. Once, Polywork was a great platform for showcasing my achievements. I highlighted everything, from open source contributions to recognition from notable individuals. However, it eventually came to an end. Then, I learned about OpenSauced , and long story short, I became one of the documentation maintainers and learned much more about the project. It was an awesome tool that had a cool feature for highlighting open source contributions, making it super easy to link my highlights page on my resume. It was the perfect solution... until it wasn't. When it was deprecated, I was back to square one. Well, sometimes, inspiration strikes in the least expected places. Yes, that's correct. The moment of inspiration struck me during a family summer vacation, while I was relaxing on the couch. A few months ago, I took a long summer vacation with my family. I was intentionally tech-free, laptop-less, and simply enjoying the time together. One day, while I was lounging on the couch and watching a series, the idea of having an open source portfolio suddenly came to mind. I thought, \"There must be a way to automate this process.\" I decided to explore using the GitHub API to build the portfolio. But here's the thing. I didn't have the deep API knowledge, and I certainly didn't want to ruin my family time by reading documentation for hours. So, with no laptop and stuck on this idea, I figured Id try vibe coding a shotsomething Ive never tried before. Honestly, Im a bit of a skeptic when it comes to AI, and I really struggle with creating effective prompts. I'm aware that if my prompts aren't optimal, I could quickly use up my free credits, and I don't want to wait a long time to get new ones. But there will always be a first time for everything, and you don't know how it goes unless you try, right? I want my portfolio to not only track and record all progress, but also reflect personal truths about my contributions. So, I had some ideas about what to include and exclude in the project. I primarily contribute to and maintain projects owned by organizations or other individuals. I dont currently have my own dedicated open source repository. This means if the tool tracks all my activity, it would include things like personal configuration changes or quick sandbox tests in my own repos, which aren't open source contributions. My portfolio must be a log of pure collaboration work. Therefore, the script had to be designed from the ground up to only capture activity (PRs, issues) outside of my personal GitHub repositories. As a contributor or maintainer, I sometimes interact with private repositories belonging to the organizations I work with. Including these activities in a public portfolio feels ethically wrongI don't own the data, and the work is not (yet) open source. To keep the portfolio clean, public, and ethically sound, the script needed a strict filter to exclude all contributions made in any organization's private repositories. As a maintainer, a significant chunk of my workflow is routine: reviewing and merging PRs from bots like Dependabot. While this is important hygiene work, it doesn't showcase my technical expertise or human interaction. Therefore, the log needed to reflect genuine human collaboration. The solution had to actively exclude any PRs that were reviewed, merged, or closed if they were authored by a bot account. Maintainer tasks aren't just about merging PRs. So much value is created by answering questions, providing technical advice, helping a new contributor debug an issue in a comment thread, or explaining why an issuePR is closed or reopened, without ever needing to hit the \"Submit review\" button. This is crucial work, but it's often invisible and unrecognized. My portfolio must capture these kinds of contributions. The script needed a dedicated category to track \"Collaborations\"any issue or PR where I commented to discuss or assist, but didn't submit a formal review. I needed to filter information, set ethical boundaries, and consider efforts as a whole. So, I decided to create a smart, opinionated tracker. This project, the Curated Open Source Portfolio , was built using my phone. I pieced together the project using my smartphone, the GitHub mobile app, a mobile browser, and Gemini 2.5 Flash as my AI coding assistant (because it's free!). It was a tough way to work. The small screen made navigation and testing a nightmare. The only way to test my changes was to push them directly to my main branch and let the GitHub Action workflow run. It was an intense, time-consuming debugging process. I was relying heavily on the AI to help me structure the Node.js script and compose the necessary GitHub API queries. My Curated Open Source Portfolio is a system that finally puts my contribution tracking on autopilot. What used to take me hours of manual logging and formatting now happens automatically in minutes. Its built around a Node.js script and a GitHub Actions workflow, adhering strictly to my definition of a valuable, ethical contribution. This script uses the GitHub API to find my activity. The core here is the \"Smart Syncing\" logic, which dictates how and what data is fetched. To balance efficiency and data integrity, the script is designed to run in two modes: A fast incremental update , which fetches only new activity to minimize API calls and keep the system running efficiently. A full synchronization , which rebuilds the portfolio from scratch to clear the cache and verify all data since the tracking began. The script then applies the Four Filters and looks for four key contribution types outside of my own repositories: Merged PRs: Tracking my PRs that are merged Issues: Tracking bug reports or feature requests that I submitted Reviewed PRs: Tracking PRs that I formally review Collaborations: Tracking my first comments and discussions on someone else's issuesPRs Achieving all four ethical filters required careful query construction. For instance, to ensure quality and collaboration, the search query for finding reviewed PRs had to use specific exclusion filters. This is one part of the complex query string the script generates: The complete solution uses a combination of these search operators and additional JavaScript logic in the script to ensure that no PRs from known bots or contributions within my personal repositories are included in the final report. This is what makes it hands-free. It has two schedules, effectively minimizing API requests while ensuring total data history: A light daily update ( '0 1   ' ) that triggers the script's incremental sync to keep things fresh. A thorough monthly full sync ( '1 0 1  ' ) that initiates a complete data refresh. It deletes the local cache and data files to rebuild the entire contribution history from the year I started tracking, ensuring accuracy. The Action runs the script, and then automatically commits the newly generated Markdown reports back to the repository. The final output is a collection of detailed, quarterly Markdown reports that summarize my work, including statistics and top contributed projects. It's a clean, verifiable, and constantly updated portfolio that I can be proud of. This \"vibe coding\" experience taught me some invaluable lessons about building with AI, especially for developers who are still learning certain technologies. The AI can write the code, but you have to be the architect. You still need a fundamental understanding of what you're building. Even though I struggled with the GitHub API syntax, I understood the logic of what I needed: fetch data, process it, and write it to a file. This basic knowledge lets me guide the AI effectively. This is the biggest takeaway. Don't just accept the code the AI gives you. Get critical. Ask questions. Challenge the approach. I found that I had to push back on Gemini a lot: \"Can you run me through the code line by line and explain what they do?\" \"That suggested query seems too complex and takes a while to process. Can we simplify it?\" \"This script needs to only look for activity outside of my own repositories. How can we ensure the API query handles that exclusion?\" \"You're suggesting a whole new library, but can we just do this with native Node.js?\" \"Why did you come with this approach and not that approach? What's the difference? What's the impact?\" Sometimes, the AI would change its approach and agree with a simpler solution. Other times, it would persistently suggest things that were far too complicated or unnecessary for my simple application. Always be critical, and still check your facts with a quick Google search. Vibe coding is an accelerator, especially when you need to bridge a knowledge gap quickly (like crafting the GitHub API query without hours of documentation reading). But the final code qualityits simplicity, efficiency, and effectivenessis entirely up to the human review and critical challenge. If my story resonates with youthe contributor who wants to track their journey but is tired of the manual effortI encourage you to try out this automation or build one your own! This repository serves as a portfolio of my open source contributions. You can check out the contributions log in the contributions folder to see my work. My goal in creating this log is to maintain a detailed and organized record of my work, containing pull requests (PRs), bug reports, and general collaborations. It's a way for me to track my journey and share my contributions with the community. The content in this repository is generated automatically using a GitHub Action. I plan to add more details and functions in the future. This project is powered by a Node.js script and a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically fetches, processes, and presents GitHub activity. The core logic is designed to track and categorize activity outside of the owner's own repositories . The script performs the following key functions: You can finally focus on what matters most: contributing to open source , not managing a spreadsheet. While the current system is stable and fully automated, this project is far from finished. I plan to add more features in the future. This ongoing development means one thing is constant: I must continue to manually check and refine the code the AI helped generate. I'll focus on ensuring the logicfrom the Node.js implementation to the underlying data requestsremains simple, efficient, and, most importantly, true to the ethical and collaborative principles on which I built this portfolio. This project is a testament to the power of a good idea, even if it starts on a phone during a vacation. It shows that with modern AI tools, you don't need to be an API expert to build sophisticated solutions. You only need curiosity, critical thinking, and a willingness to try something new. What are you building with the help of AI to make your life easier as a developer? I'd love to hear your stories!",

        "content": "A context manager in Python is a special object that manages the setup and cleanup of resources automatically when the with statement is used. It ensures that resources like files, network connections, or locks are properly acquired and released, even if an error occurs during use. A context manager defines two methods: It is like a regular context manager but supports asynchronous setup and teardown. It is ideal for managing resources in async code (like connections, files, locks). Note : async with automatically awaits __aenter__ and __aexit__ coroutines. It is an object from which can be async for to receive values asynchronously. It is useful in cases where there is a need to iterate over asynchronous streams of data  for example, reading from async sockets, files, or APIs streaming data. It allows handling each item as it arrives without blocking the event loop. When working with real-world async programs, there is a need to interact with external resources like HTTP APIs or databases. Libraries such as aiohttp (for HTTP) and aiomysql (for MySQL) wrap these services so they work seamlessly with Python's asyncio event loop. aiohttp allows sending HTTP requests using asyncawait. It allows working with many URLs at once. aiomysql is an async driver for MySQL databases. It is built for asyncio. Many frameworks now support async views. For example: Django : It supports async views since version 3.1. Quart : Flask-inspired, built for async: Python 3.11 brought several improvements and new features to the asyncio module: We have covered a lot in this article and our article series. In the upcoming article, we will go deeper into asyncio's Interview Questions and practice some of its commonly asked and used Problems. Stay tuned to unlock the full power of Pythons asynchronous programming!",

        "content": "Argentina's President Javier Milei celebrates after winning in legislative midterm elections in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025. Rodrigo AbdAP hide caption BUENOS AIRES, Argentina  Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei won decisive victories in key districts in midterm elections Sunday, clinching a crucial vote of confidence that strengthens his ability to carry out his radical free-market experiment with billions of dollars in backing from the Trump administration. In the election widely seen as a referendum on Milei's past two years in office, his upstart La Libertad Avanza party scored over 40 of votes compared with 31 for the left-leaning populist opposition movement, known as Peronism, exceeding analysts' projections. Milei, a key ideological ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, said his party and allied blocs picked up 14 seats in the Senate and 64 in the lower house of Congress on Sunday, bolstering the government's support in the legislature enough to uphold presidential vetoes and block impeachment efforts. At La Libertad Avanza headquarters late Sunday in downtown Buenos Aires, a beaming Milei hailed the election sweep as a mandate to press forward with his spending cuts and introduce ambitious tax and labor reforms. The results also automatically position him as a candidate for reelection in 2027. \"The Argentine people have decided to leave behind 100 years of decadence,\" Milei exulted as his supporters cheered, referring to a succession of Peronist governments that brought Argentina infamy for its inflationary spirals and sovereign debt defaults. \"Today we have passed the turning point. Today we begin the construction of a great Argentina.\" A woman holds a banner reading in Spanish, \"Trump or homeland,\" outside former President Cristina Fernandez's home, where she is serving a six-year house arrest sentence for corruption, after polls closed during legislative midterm elections in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025. Natacha PisarenkoAP hide caption Perhaps never has an Argentine legislative election generated so much interest in Washington and Wall Street. Trump appeared to condition a 20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina's central bank and an additional 20 billion loan from private banks on a good showing for Milei in national midterms, threatening to rescind the assistance for the cash-strapped country in the event of a Peronist victory. \"If he wins we're staying with him, and if he doesn't win, we're gone,\" Trump said after welcoming Milei to the White House earlier this month. Those contentious comments added to mounting pressure on Milei, who has scrambled to avert a currency crisis since the Peronist opposition won a landslide victory in Buenos Aires provincial polls last month. Argentina's bonds and currency nosedived as markets sensed that the public was losing patience with Milei's reforms and that the midterm race would be tight. To stem the run on the peso, Milei burned through billions of dollars in foreign exchange reserves to shore up the peso. In an extraordinary move, the U.S. Treasury then came to the rescue, selling dollars to help meet soaring demand for greenbacks and finalizing the credit line. In the end, the Peronist alliance performed poorly, underscoring how weak the once-dominant movement has become in the Milei era, largely as a result of internal divisions. Markets were widely expected to rally on Monday. \"For foreign investors, this outcome is a relief because it shows that the Milei program can be sustainable,\" said Marcelo J. García, the America's director for the geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"It leaves the opposition weakened and fragmented, just as it was when Milei won the presidency in December 2023,\" Garcia added. The Peronist coalition has struggled to channel rising public anger with Milei's painful austerity measures into a new political strategy after delivering the economic shambles that the chain saw-wielding outsider inherited in late 2023. Trump, while on his way to Japan on Monday, posted on Truth Social that Milei was \"doing a wonderful job\" after his party beat expectations in midterm elections. \"Our confidence in him was justified by the People of Argentina,\" Trump wrote. Milei responded to Trump's post, calling him \"a great friend\" of Argentina and thanking him for \"trusting the Argentine people.\" The results showed Milei's young libertarian party gaining support across the country  including in some surprising corners that have long been under the sway of Peronism. In the closely watched Buenos Aires province, a Peronist stronghold home to nearly 40 of the electorate, La Libertad Avanza eked out a razor-thin victory Sunday. Just last month, the Peronists beat Milei's party there by a whopping 14 percentage points. Axel Kicillof, governor of Buenos Aires province and the most influential elected official in the Peronist opposition, criticized Trump for putting his thumb on the scale. He warned that the billions of dollars in financial aid from the U.S. Treasury and investment banks would do nothing to help ordinary Argentines squeezed by Milei's cuts to subsidies or forced out of business by a contracting economy. \"I want to make it clear that neither the U.S. government nor JP Morgan are charitable societies,\" he said. \"If they come to Argentina, it is for nothing other than to take a profit.\" With Milei's efforts to deregulate the economy and scrap tariffs winning over Argentina's powerful agriculture sector, La Libertad Avanza also swept Santa Fe, which dominates soybean production and processing, and Córdoba, another powerhouse farming province.

Given the limited number of seats up for grabs in this election, it was mathematically impossible for Milei to secure a majority in either house. \"This victory is necessary, but not sufficient to maintain control of Congress,\" said political consultant Sergio Berensztein. \"The government must build a broad and effective coalition with like-minded forces.\" Seeking to capitalize quickly on Sunday's results, Milei said he called the country's powerful provincial governors to accelerate agreements on long-term economic reform. Sunday's outcome will also test public patience for Milei's cost-cutting measures in the coming months. Although Milei's budget cuts have significantly driven down inflation  from an annual high of 289 in April 2024 to 32 last month  the price increases still outpace salaries and pensions. The electorate appears increasingly polarized between beneficiaries of Milei's reforms and those who say they're struggling to make ends meet like never before. In the financial district of Puerto Madero, luxury car dealerships report sales surging since Milei scrapped import restrictions. Streets bustle with bankers who praise the president for ending a yearslong ban on selling dollars online. Fine restaurants serve Argentine oil executives who gush about his efforts to draw foreign investment. But at a soup kitchen on the other side of Argentina's Riachuelo River, Epifanía Contreras, 64, said she feels like she's bearing the brunt of the cutbacks. \"You can't live on 290,000 pesos a month with today's inflation,\" she said, describing how her 200 monthly pension has shriveled in value since Milei cut cost-of-living increases. \"The situation is getting worse and worse.\" Reflecting widespread public resignation, electoral authorities reported a turnout rate of just under 68 Sunday, among the lowest recorded since the nation's 1983 return to democracy. Voting is compulsory in Argentina. \"I vote out of obligation, nothing more,\" said Matías Paredes, 50, a real estate broker whose foreign clientele vanished with Milei's strong exchange rate. \"None of these figures inspire optimism. We're just choosing the lesser evil.\"",

        "title": "'Patchwork' pieces together Jane Austen's personal life",
        "content": "In an early scene in Kate Evans' Patchwork: A Graphic Biography of Jane Austen , she depicts 3-month-old, bundled-up baby Jane being smuggled out through the back door of her family's large home. The man who takes the baby is John Littleworth, a local tenant farmer, whose wife, Elizabeth, will care for the infant in their modest cottage for a small fee until Jane, at 2 years old, is returned. In the notes section at the end of the book, Evans admits that the real Lizzy Littleworth would have been older than the visual depiction of her in the biography. But by warping this historical detail, Evans intended to emphasize the central role that such a \"vibrant and attractive\" presence would have had on the Austen children; she wanted, in other words, to lead readers into a richer appreciation of Austen's relationship with her mother and, in turn, the world-famous novelist's complicated views on motherhood, mother-daughter relationships and class divisions. A page from Patchwork: A Graphic Biography of Jane Austen by Kate Evans. Kate EvansVerso hide caption While some might be bothered by a biography that regularly, and proudly, takes liberties with facts and chronology, such artistry is the heart and strength of Evans' delightful and illuminating Patchwork . This energetic book, brimming with bright pages of illustration paired with often bounteous text, is premised on a piecing together  hence, the crafting metaphor of its title  of the threadbare record of its subject's short but productive life. The book will be highly satisfying to anyone craving more companionship with Jane Austen, both her life and her work. Evans is the author-artist of an equally compelling 2015 graphic biography about Rosa Luxemburg. This latest book, which parses out the internal and external workings of a very different kind of life, is built around clips and snippets. These come from Evans' extensive research of biographies, academic studies and related Jane Austen texts and archives, as well as excerpts from Austen's novels, poems and the letters exchanged between the novelist and her (mostly) loved ones. Many of Austen's letters were famously burned after her death, by her sister, Cassandra, who was likely intending to preserve her beloved's reputation. Hence, even this already incongruous record is full of holes. A page from Patchwork: A Graphic Biography of Jane Austen . Kate EvansVerso hide caption But Evans' strategy, of whimsy and play side by side with serious excavation, turns gaps and uncertainties into opportunities for greater connection and insight. Sometimes, for example, the gentle riffing preserves the potency of lingering images from Austen's novels, even if these contradict historical fact. \"I was not prepared to let the truth get in the way of a Pride  Prejudice reference,\" the biographer explains in one note, of her choice to color a depiction of Austen's adored brother, Henry, in a scarlet rather than blue military coat, in deference to a line from the novel. Other times, Evans seeks to make visible historical contexts generally ignored in discussions or representations of Austen and her fiction. In the interlude to the book, the biographer briefly but powerfully broadens the scope of her project, attempting to show how the world in which Austen lived was premised on the blood, sweat, tears and freedom of a variety of subjects living around the globe at the same time. These included child workers in Lancashire, weavers in Dhaka, Irish laborers in the countryside, and Black slaves on southern American plantations. Such unexpected forays sharpen the biography, expanding what it means to think about Austen's world. A page from Patchwork: A Graphic Biography of Jane Austen by Kate Evans. Kate EvansVerso hide caption The publication of this book coincides with the 250th anniversary of Austen's birth year. Austen, who died in 1817 at 41 years old, wrote six novels over the course of her life that would eventually garner her worldwide renown and that have remained nearly constantly in print since her death. Only four of these novels, beginning with Sense and Sensibility in 1811, were published during her lifetime, and they were attributed to an anonymous author (\"By a lady\"). For the most part, Austen would live and die at the hands of other people's patronage and loyalty. While much ink has been spilled on various facets of her personal life  whole mythologies have been constructed, for example, on the scant evidence that remains of Jane's possible romantic dalliances  Evans is most interested in tracking \"A mind lively, and at ease,\" in all the complexity that such a description entails. It was a mind that deftly captured, and somehow made broadly sympathetic and relatable, \"the ordinary trauma of the English upper class,\" including, especially, the lives of women. While the contributions that Austen's careful eye and sardonic pen have made are impossible to quantify, the vitality of her vision is easily felt on every page of this sensitive work of deep appreciation.

This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain team. It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else. In 1977, when Eric Schwartz was 15 years old, his mother took her own life. The loss was unexpected and devastating. A few days later, Schwartz, his father and his brother took a trip from their small hometown in New York to Florida. \"My dad thought it was the right place to go to get away from any reminder of my mom or anybody that we knew in town, just to kind of regroup and recover and figure out what was next,\" Schwartz recalled. When they returned, Schwartz had to go back to school, but he didn't want to. \"It was awkward. Everybody knew in town what had happened. And I think it's awkward, too, for teachers when they encounter a student who had lost a parent, but it was especially awkward, I think, in my case because of the way my mother had died.\" Schwartz didn't want to discuss his mother's death and was grateful that his first day back, most of his teachers didn't mention the loss. His last class of the day was choir, with a teacher named Renato Vellutino, or Dr. V for short. Vellutino was beloved by his students and known to always be ready to lend a helping hand. On that day, when class ended, Schwartz just happened to be one of the last students to leave the choir room. \"At the end of class you had to file out through a set of double doors that are sitting next to the piano where Vellutino was seated.\" \"And as I was walking by, he stood up from behind the piano, grabbed me and pulled me into a bear hug. And he didn't say anything. And I didn't say anything. And really, we didn't need any words,\" Schwartz said. \"I knew he cared about me and that he felt my pain. And that's really all that mattered.\" Vellutino's hug changed Schwartz's life. \"That emotional gesture really stuck with me for the rest of my life. And so, in the ensuing years, I've tried to pass along that gesture to people that I encounter that may be in pain or hurting or in trouble and need to know without any words that there's someone there who actually cares,\" Schwartz said. Around 20 years after Schwartz received that hug, he got to reconnect with his former teacher at a high school reunion. The two men shared another hug and Schwartz got to tell Vellutino how much that moment meant to him. \" We got a little teary eyed and both of us remembered that day.\" Vellutino died in 2023 at the age of 91.

        "content": "Art expert Agnes Sevestre-Barbe points to a rediscovered Picasso painting \"Bust of a Woman in a Flowery Hat,\" on Wednesday in Paris. The portrait of longtime muse and partner Dora Maar sold Friday at auction for 32 million euros (about 37 million). Emma Da SilvaAP hide caption PARIS  A vividly hued Picasso portrait of longtime muse and partner Dora Maar that had remained hidden from public view for more than eight decades sold Friday at auction for 32 million euros (about 37 million), including fees  surpassing expectations but far from the artist's most expensive work ever auctioned. Painted in July 1943, \"Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat (Dora Maar)\" depicts Maar in a brightly colored floral hat. Maar, an artist and photographer herself, had been Picasso's partner and muse for about seven years, and the relationship was coming to a painful close. The work was purchased in 1944 and had not been on the market since, remaining in the family collection. The painting, part of Picasso's \"Woman in a Hat\" series, was auctioned at the Drouot auction house in Paris. Auctioneer Christophe Lucien called the final sale, to a buyer in the room, \"an enormous success,\" as well as a very emotional moment. He said the price  32,012,397 euros after adding buyer fees to the 27-million hammer price  was not only well above estimates but also the highest paid at auction this year for any artwork in France. Lucien called the painting \"a little piece of the story of love\"  albeit a bittersweet one  between Picasso and Maar. She was 29 when she met the artist and quickly became his muse and the model for \"Guernica,\" among other works. He later left her for the younger Francoise Gilot and she died at 89, having lived an increasingly reclusive life. Theirs \"was not a very simple story,\" Lucien said, adding that the painting came at the end of it. \"You see that she was containing tears because she understood that Picasso was leaving her.\" At a preview this week, Picasso specialist Agnès Sevestre-Barbé marveled at how vivid the portrait has remained. \"We have a painting that is exactly as it was when it left the studio,\" she said. \"It wasn't varnished, which means we have all its raw material, all of it. It's a painting where you can feel all the colors, the entire chromatic range.\" \"It's a painting that speaks for itself,\" she added. \"You just have to look at it  it's full of expression, and you can see all of Picasso's genius.\" Previously, Sevestre-Barbé noted, the work had only been seen in a black-and-white photograph. \"We couldn't imagine from this photo that this painting was so colorful, so amazing, really.\" Auctioneer Lucien said before the sale that the work was of huge interest across the globe. \"It's being talked about in all the world capitals with a strong art market, from the United States to Asia, and of course through all the major European markets,\" he said. Though selling above expectations, the work was far from the most expensive Picasso work sold at auction. In 2023, the artist's famed \"Femme à la montre\" (\"Woman with a Watch\")  portraying another muse, Marie-Thérèse Walter  sold for 139.4 million, the second most valuable Picasso sold at auction. The most valuable was 179.4 million , paid in 2015 for a version of \"Les Femmes d'Alger\" (\"Women of Algiers\").",

        "title": "Trump threatens Canada with 10% extra import tax over anti-tariffs ad",
        "content": "President Trump speaks with reporters aboard Air Force One at Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025. Mark SchiefelbeinAP hide caption ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE  President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10 because of an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario. The ad used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs, angering Trump who said he would end trade talks with Canada . Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he would pull the ad after the weekend, and it ran Friday night during the first game of the World Series. \"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10 over and above what they are paying now.\" It was not immediately clear when the 10 hike would come into effect, nor whether it would apply to all Canadian goods. Canada's economy has been hit hard by Trump's tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been trying to work with Trump to lower them. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly 3.6 billion Canadian (2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. Many Canadian products have been hit with a 35 tariff, while steel and aluminum face rates of 50. Energy products have a lower rate of 10, while other goods covered by the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement are exempt. That trade agreement is slated for review. Trump negotiated the deal in his first term, but has since soured on it. Trump and Carney will both attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. But Trump told reporters traveling with him that he had no intention of meeting Carney there. Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad spelling out the case against tariffs. Trump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs , a key part of his economic strategy.",

        "content": "Ontario Premier Doug Ford speaks during an event with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Feb. 11 in Washington, D.C. Mark SchiefelbeinAP hide caption As Doug Ford campaigned to become Ontario's premier in 2018, he put out a very Trumpian vibe . On the trail, he attacked the media and the elites, raged against measures to combat climate change, vowed to cut income taxes and gas prices, and even expressed support for President Trump's policies. It might seem surprising then to now see Ford  who is in charge of Canada's largest province  taking the lead in opposing Trump's harsh tariffs as Prime Minister Mark Carney scrambles to manage the fallout from U.S.-Canada trade tensions. In recent months, Ford's criticism of Trump has been growing, most recently in the form of a television ad featuring the words of President Ronald Reagan warning in a 1987 radio address against the perils of protectionism. The ad has attracted Trump's ire and appears, at least temporarily, to have derailed trade talks between the two countries. Who exactly is Doug Ford and what accounts for this political 180? Three generations of the former businessman's family have served as elected officials, and Ford began his political career on the Toronto City Council from 2010 to 2014. The period was marked by the dramatic fall from grace of his younger brother, then-Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who admitted to smoking crack cocaine and then was dogged by evidence of a string of other abusive behavior. In the same year that Rob Ford publicly admitted to drug use, The Globe and Mail published an exposé that said the brothers had dealt hashish in the 1980s. Rob Ford died from a rare form of cancer in 2016. Just two years after his brother's death, Doug Ford's political fortunes blossomed. He and his right-of-center Progressive Conservative Party won a majority in Ontario , riding discontent against the Liberal Party, who were coming off 15 years in power in the province. \"Doug Ford got elected in large measure to get rid of a very unpopular government,\" says Steve Paikin, a long-time political analyst and host of the Paikin Podcast , a weekly current affairs podcast in Canada. Paikin says after Ford's success in 2018, he made the mistake of assuming Ontario had voted for his agenda, when in fact the Progressive Conservatives' election success was mostly about removing the Liberals. \"He got into office practicing a kind of disruptive, robust populism on steroids, which made his government, frankly, the most unpopular I had ever seen,\" Paikin says. That's when he decided to tack to the center. In the years that followed, Ford reached out to Canada's left, including the now-prime minister. He also won praise even from critics for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic response in Ontario. \"COVID saved him. When the COVID crisis hit, he suddenly realized that all the kind of populist, anti-science, anti-expertise, 'we're just going to wing it by the seat of our pants,' that wasn't going to work,\" Paikin says. \"He suddenly realized, I need to rely on experts.\" NPR reached out to Ford's office for an interview with the premier, but received no response. When former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he would step down in March this year, just as the White House was preparing its April 2 \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, Ford moved in to fill the vacuum, emerging as the voice of the anti-tariff response . By the time of his second reelection bid earlier this year, Ford's early enthusiasm for Trump had long faded. On the campaign trail, he donned a baseball cap that mocked the red \"Make America Great Again\" hats  Ford's blue cap, worn at a news conference in January, read \"Canada is not for sale.\" \"President Trump is promising steep and sweeping tariffs that will devastate our economy and put hundreds of thousands of people out of work,\" Ford told voters . \"Whether he imposes tariffs next week, next month or waits a year, President Trump's threats are not going away. With a strong mandate from the people, I will do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.\" After winning reelection in February, Ford threatened to cut off electricity to homes in the U.S. in retaliation for the tariffs and Trump's threats to annex Canada. Ford also canceled a 100 million contract with Elon Musk's SpaceX to provide Starlink services to the country. Ford's stance won him the sobriquet \"Captain Canada.\" Trump announced Friday that he was ending all trade negotiations with Canada over the ad featuring Reagan. Ford subsequently said that after talking with Carney, he had decided to pause the advertising campaign, calling it a success for having reached U.S. audiences. In an X post on Friday, Ford wrote: \"Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies.\" In a statement later, he said : \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\" \"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,\" he added. Paikin suggests that because of their close relationship, Carney and Ford are playing a game of \"good cop, bad cop\" with the anti-tariff ads  Ford gets to ramp up the rhetoric as Carney plays deal maker. \"Mark Carney ran on a platform of elbows up and ever since he became the prime minister, the elbows have definitely been down,\" Paikin says. \"He's trying to take a more muted approach.\" \"The other side of the coin is that Doug Ford is free to do whatever he wants.\"",

Matthias BalkAFP via Getty Images hide caption German police say they've broken up an international art forgery ring that tried to sell works purportedly by Pablo Picasso, Rembrandt, Frida Kahlo and others for tens of millions of dollars to unsuspecting collectors. The scheme was allegedly led by a 77-year-old German man from Bavaria with the help of ten accomplices, according to a press release from the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office. Patrick Haggenmueller, head of the Art Investigation Unit of the Bavarian State Criminal Police Office (BLKA), stands next to the fake painting Mary with Child supposedly by Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck. Matthias BalkAFP via Getty Images hide caption Investigators say they discovered the fraud when the main suspect tried to sell two supposedly original Picasso works, including a portrait of the Spanish painter's muse Dora Maar. (A Picasso painting of Maar entitled Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat sold last week for around 37 million, after having been held in a family collection since it was purchased in 1944.) The unnamed ringleader apparently also tried to sell a copy of a world-famous painting by the Dutch painter Rembrandt van Rijn known as The Syndics , a 17th century portrait of members of Amsterdam's cloth makers' guild, for roughly 150 million. But the original of that painting, known in Dutch as De Staalmeesters , sits in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Police say the fake was likely a copy from the 20th century owned by an 84-year-old Swiss woman, who is now also under investigation by German and Swiss authorities. Authorities say the 77-year-old main suspect tried to sell a Rembrandt painting known as The Syndics . That work, known in Dutch as De Staalmeesters , is part of the collection of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum. Matthias BalkAFP via Getty Images hide caption Other phony works allegedly offered for sale by the 77-year-old suspect included ceramic vases by Picasso, Study of a Head by Amadeo Modigliani, and pieces purportedly by Peter Paul Rubens, Joan Miró and Anthony van Dyck. Purchase prices ranged from about 460,000 to more than 16 million. One accomplice in the scheme was a 74-year-old man from Rhineland-Palatinate who produced counterfeit expert reports attesting to the authenticity of the forgeries, investigators say. A coordinated series of searches by police one morning earlier this month at more than a dozen locations in Germany, Switzerland and Lichtenstein yielded a number of suspected forgeries, which are set to be analyzed by art experts in the coming weeks.",

Ashley and Nick have decided to have only one child, a choice many people are making around the world. The trend is triggering an unprecedented shift toward rapidly aging and gradually shrinking populations. Lauren Petracca for NPR hide caption Families in the U.S. and around the world are having fewer children as people make profoundly different decisions about their lives. NPR's series Population Shift: How Smaller Families Are Changing the World explores the causes and implications of this trend. Ashley and Nick Evancho say raising their 3-year-old, Sophia, is one of the most joyous things they've ever done. \"Watching my daughter run around in the yard is otherworldly for me,\" Ashley said on a recent afternoon in their home in Grand Island, a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y. But the Evanchos also made a decision that's increasingly common for families in the U.S. and around the world: One is enough. \"I don't need another one. I don't want another one. I love having only one child,\" said Ashley Evancho, who works as a financial planner. Her husband, Nick, an Episcopal priest, agreed that big families make less sense in today's economy. \"It really stacks the chips economically against you,\" he said. Sophia and her mom play together at home. \"I don't need another one. I don't want another one. I love having only one child,\" Ashley Evancho told NPR. Lauren Petracca for NPR hide caption Worldwide, the number of children born to the average family has dropped by more than half since the 1970s, according to the latest United Nations data . Economists say having fewer children is the norm for many families, especially in relatively prosperous countries like the U.S. The trend is leading to populations that are dramatically older, and beginning to shrink, in many of the world's biggest economies. \"This demographic issue is poised to potentially remake so much of our society,\" said Melissa Kearney , an economist at the University of Notre Dame. Experts say a rapidly aging and gradually shrinking population in the world's wealthiest countries could force sweeping changes in people's lives, causing many to work longer before retirement, making it harder for business owners to find employees and destabilizing eldercare and health insurance programs. Already, women in the 15 countries that account for 75 of global gross domestic product, including the U.S., are having too few children to maintain a stable population. Many of those nations have fallen into the \"very low\" category of \"total fertility rate\" identified by the U.N. as a serious concern. \"For the countries below 1.4 births per woman, we see much faster population decline and a pronounced shift in the population age distribution to the older ages,\" said Vladimíra Kantorová, the U.N.'s chief population scientist. The rate of births per woman in the U.S. dropped to 1.6 in 2024, the lowest ever . In China, Japan, Italy and South Korea, deaths already outpace births. Demographers say more high-income countries would face population decline, if not for high rates of immigration. \"We seem to be kind of watching a science fiction novel,\" said Nicholas Eberstadt, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C. According to Eberstadt, worker shortages, shrinking numbers of young consumers and a growing wave of elderly retirees relying on pension and health care systems could challenge basic assumptions about global capitalism. This trend is being heightened by the fact that people in the U.S. and many other countries are living longer. The global population of people age 80 or older will triple between 2020 and 2050, according to the World Health Organization . \"Turning the population pyramid upside down basically upsets the business model, the background music, that we've had in modern life for as long as we can remember,\" he said. Some parts of the U.S. are already feeling the population shift as communities age and begin to shrink. In Franklin County, N.Y., where storefronts sit empty in Malone, the county seat, the population has declined by roughly 10 since 2010. Half the counties in the U.S. now have more elderly retirees than children, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Brian MannNPR hide caption In the U.S., the world's largest economy, this trend has been building for decades. Families started shrinking in the 1960s, when the average American woman had between three and four children. Now, according to U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Bank data , the typical woman will have one or two children in her lifetime, with a growing number of families opting for no children at all . \"I think it raises questions about do we want to be a more dynamic, forward-looking economy where people are optimistic about the future and about their ability to have kids?\" said Kearney at Notre Dame. With fewer children being born, population growth in the U.S. has already slowed. The population is expected to begin shrinking later this century, according to U.S. Census Bureau projections . Americans are also significantly older, with the median age rising from 28.1 in 1970 to a record high last year of 39.1. Many communities, especially in rural America, already face serious demographic challenges. \"The decline here you see started a long time ago,\" said Jeremy Evans, head of the Franklin County Industrial Development Agency in rural upstate New York. Jeremy Evans heads the Franklin County Industrial Development Agency. In developing a new economic plan for his community, Evans concluded that population loss, especially the declining population of young people, is the top concern. In many parts of the U.S., elderly retirees outnumber children. Brian MannNPR hide caption Franklin County, which lies near the U.S.-Canada border, has lost roughly 10 of its population since 2010. Some of that is due to young people leaving, but so few babies are born here that the local hospital closed its maternity ward three years ago. According to Evans, there are plenty of good jobs, with an unemployment rate of just 3.8 , but not enough workers to fill them. \"It became obvious: We have to make this the No. 1 focus,\" he said. \"Our No. 1 mission is attracting 18-to-39-year-olds,\" he said. But economists say recruiting young people will get harder nationwide as smaller families continue to transform the American population. Last year, the number of children in the U.S. declined slightly, while the number of seniors surged to 61 million. Eberstadt, at the American Enterprise Institute, thinks the population shift could destabilize key U.S. programs that underpin the economy, including Social Security and Medicare. \"The way public finances are organized makes no sense if you're heading into an aging, shrinking world,\" he said. Many experts told NPR the shift toward an older, smaller population with fewer working-age residents will accelerate, if the U.S. maintains strict new limits on migrants imposed by the Trump administration. A man walks past a Human Resources and Social Security Bureau office, with the Chinese characters for \"Social Security\" visible in the background, on Sept. 2 in Chongqing, China. China's population of retirees is expected to surge by more than 200 million people by 2050. Cheng XinGetty Images hide caption If this demographic earthquake were only reshaping the U.S. economy, researchers say it would already pose serious challenges. But rapid aging and population decline are hitting America's biggest trading partners far harder and much faster. \"If you live in Europe or parts of Asia, this population shift is everything,\" said Lant Pritchett, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics. He noted that basic assumptions about capitalism and economic growth evolved when nearly every country was experiencing rapid population increases. Now that era is over. \"Hard to tell what's going to happen when things that have never happened before happen. We just don't have any examples of countries doing this successfully,\" Pritchett said. This population shift is happening fastest and on the largest scale in China, the world's second-biggest economy. According to Pritchett, China's working-age population will crash by 2050, losing more than 211 million workers. On a recent morning outside one of Beijing's busy shopping malls, it was hard to see the massive change underway here. But Mia Li, 20, who works in China's struggling real estate sector, said she's already feeling it. \"Housing prices will fall and the number of homebuyers will decrease as well,\" Li said. She doesn't have children and worries that motherhood would be expensive and risky. \"Having children requires financial support, but if the economy goes down, how can you possibly afford to raise them?\" Xiujian Peng, an expert on China's population at Victoria University in Australia, said the economic impact of the trend could be profound. \"Population will decline very fast,\" she said, adding that vast areas of rural China, home to many of the country's elderly, could face \"a huge problem.\" Ashley and Nick Evancho prepare dinner as Sophia plays in the kitchen. Nick Evancho told NPR that big families often make less sense in today's economy. \"It really stacks the chips economically against you,\" he said. Lauren Petracca for NPR hide caption Some researchers, including Harvard University economist Claudia Goldin, think fears about shrinking families are overblown. Goldin described much of the concern as a political backlash against high rates of immigration and women's empowerment. Asked about economic impacts of an aging, declining workforce, Goldin said, \"I am not worried about that. Scarcity is everywhere; trade-offs are everywhere. There is no optimal birth rate.\" But many economists believe nations, and companies, that hope to remain stable and prosperous through this transition need to begin adapting. Some may be able to compensate by attracting more migrant workers or boosting the efficiency of the labor force through education, automation and AI. In Greece, the birth rate is so low that the population is shrinking and aging. On the tiny Greek island of Thymaina, schoolchildren commute by ferry to another island as a decreasing birth rate has led to school closures. Ayman Oghanna for NPR hide caption Many countries are also rolling out programs designed to encourage a return to larger families. The Trump administration included a modest package of incentives in this year's budget, including an expanded child tax credit and a temporary program offering 1,000 investment accounts to babies born during Trump's current term. Some governments are going much further. Last month, the Greek government approved a multibillion-dollar tax package aimed at slowing Greece's rapid depopulation. \"This is an existential problem for us,\" Greece's minister of economy and finance, Kyriakos Pierrakakis, said in an interview with NPR. But many experts are skeptical of policies aimed at boosting birth rates. Past programs have shown limited or no success, apparently because much of the trend toward fewer children is driven by improvements in society  from economic progress for women to declining teen pregnancies. \"One thing about smaller families is that it's all accounted for by good things, which means it's not turning around,\" said Pritchett, at the London School of Economics. Ashley Evancho reads to Sophia before bed. Lauren Petracca for NPR hide caption Ashley Evancho, the financial planner and mom who lives near Buffalo, agrees families like hers aren't likely to have more kids, even if governments offer incentives and benefits. \"My opportunity cost, the opportunity cost to my career or my education of having more children is so much higher,\" she said. \"So the economy, the way it works, will probably have to fundamentally change.\" Reporting contributed by Jasmine Ling, NPR Beijing producer.",

        "content": "Members of the Paris Holmes Society (Cercle Holmesien de Paris), Laurence Deloision, dressed like Arsène Lupin (left), and Thierry Gilibert, dressed like Sherlock Holmes, on Saturday stage the theft by the facade and the window where thieves entered the Louvre last Sunday. Thomas PadillaAP hide caption PARIS  It was the heist heard around the world. So naturally, it was only a matter of hours before it transitioned into memes seen around the internet. Four masked thieves. Nine \"priceless\" pieces. All stolen in less than seven minutes , from the world's most famous museum. The Oct. 19 daylight robbery at the Louvre has already been compared to a Dan Brown novel or the latest installment in Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's film franchise. Now it's something else entirely  internet culture's newest obsession. From brands to influencers to actors with projects to promote (here's looking at you, George Clooney), the Louvre heist has become the latest template for going viral. The Paris prosecutor said on Sunday that a number of suspects have been arrested over the theft. The prosecutor said that investigators made the arrests on Saturday evening, adding that one of the men taken into custody was preparing to leave the country from Roissy Airport. One twist came earlier this week when Empress Eugénie's diamond-and-gold encrusted crown  one of the stolen items  was found damaged near the scene, apparently dropped or abandoned during the thieves' escape. Eight other jewels  all relics of France's imperial history  remain missing. The estimated value of the items is 102 million (88 million euros), though France's interior ministry described the jewels as \"priceless.\" France's culture minister called the theft a \"humiliation.\" The museum's director admitted that the heist \"was not inevitable,\" acknowledging the failure of its security. The Louvre's protection systems are expected to face more scrutiny in the coming weeks, particularly as questions grow about the lack of security cameras in the museum's Apollo Gallery, where the robbery took place. The thieves entered the second-floor gallery via a window using an electric lift  which they also used to scurry back down to ground level before jumping on scooters toward the nearest highway. Police officers work by a basket lift used by thieves Sunday, Oct. 19, 2025 at the Louvre museum in Paris. Thibault CamusAP hide caption On Friday, Böcker, the German machinery company that made the lift entered the conversation, releasing a cheeky post featuring an ad across its social media pages. The ad features a photo of its ladder propped against the Louvre's façade with the caption, \"If you're in a hurry, Böcker Agilo carries up to 400 kg of treasures at 42 m per minute  as quiet as a whisper.\" A post shared by Böcker Maschinenwerke GmbH (boeckermaschinenwerke) It was part ad, part wink. Suddenly, the family-run company's longtime slogan \"my way to the top\" has gained new meaning. They weren't alone. IKEA Switzerland posted its own tongue-in-cheek ad promoting a glass-dome display case. The caption read: \"Won't protect your crown jewels either. But it will give them the right spotlight.\" A post shared by IKEA Switzerland (ikeaswitzerland) Others on TikTok and Instagram have turned the Louvre heist into a Halloween costume : think black jumpsuits, leather gloves, sleek sunglasses, and glittering imitation jewels. \"Heists are so back!\" the fashion influencer clothesfordinner declared A post shared by sarah  clothes for dinner (clothesfordinner) Part of the fascination comes from the fantasy the story invites. \"How thrilling, upon hearing the news, to put oneself in the shoes of the thieves, and imagine making off with the diamonds scot-free,\" The Atlantic staff writer Caity Weaver wrote in a recent piece chronicling the public's obsession with the heist. Or to put the obsession even more simply: \"How nice to read about a heist rather than a massacre.\" The stolen trinkets, Weaver writes, \"have garnered far more attention now than they would have had they remained on view at the Louvre for 5,000 years.\" George Clooney arrives at the AFI Fest premiere of the film \"Jay Kelly\" on Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025, at TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. Chris PizzelloInvision via AP hide caption Perhaps she's onto something. And perhaps that's why Hollywood, for its part, couldn't resist the moment, either. George Clooney  who plays master thief Danny Ocean in the Ocean's franchise  joked at a film premiere last week, \"They seem to have done a pretty good job of getting away with it  I was very proud of those guys.\" Asked whether the heist might inspire the upcoming Ocean's 14 film , Clooney quipped, \"I think we should rob the Louvre.\" And then there's the dapper man the internet has decided is on the case. After the robbery, an Associated Press photographer captured a young looking well-dressed passerby near the Louvre's gates  coat, tie, and fedora  as police sealed off the museum. Online, he was instantly dubbed \"a more dashing version of the famed Inspector Clouseau\" from the Pink Panther franchise, supposedly a suave detective investigating the theft. Police officers block an access to the Louvre museum after a robbery Sunday, Oct. 19, 2025, in Paris. Thibault CamusAP hide caption The AP photographer, Thibault Camus, later said the man was simply walking past. \"He appeared in front of me, I saw him, I took the photo,\" Camus says. \"He passed by and left.\" Still, the image took off, racking up millions of views and a flood of memes. Even the Paris prosecutor's office seemed to play along. In a reply to AP regarding whether the mystery man was a part of the official investigation, officials replied with a wink: \"We'd rather keep the mystery alive ;).\"",

        "title": "5 things to know about Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister",
        "content": "Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has worked in politics since 1993 and spent many years in the late Shinzo Abe's administration. Kim Kyung-HoonPoolGetty Images hide caption Japan's first-ever female prime minister , Sanae Takaichi, is a conservative with a traditional view of gender roles and a penchant for heavy metal music. Japan's parliament elected Takaichi on Tuesday, several weeks after she was chosen to lead the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has spent much of the last seven decades in power. The LDP is seen as shifting further to the right: It was only able to elect Takaichi by forming an alliance with a right-wing populist party, after losing its longtime coalition partner earlier this month. Takaichi, 64, is \"one of the most conservative people in Japan's conservative LDP,\" explains Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan. She has advocated for tougher immigration restrictions and embraced hawkish policies on China. She has drawn comparisons to the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for whom she has frequently expressed her admiration and often wears blue suits in tribute. But she also played drums in a band in college, cites Deep Purple and Iron Maiden as some of her favorite bands, once belted a rock anthem on national TV and appears to maintain a strong affinity for motorcycles and cars . \"Those are part of the character that is promoted by her, that she is more than just the strong Iron Lady, but also somebody who can have some fun,\" Hall says. Here's what else to know about Japan's new leader. Sanae Takaichi bows as she was elected Japan's new prime minister during a parliament session in Tokyo on Tuesday. Eugene HoshikoAP hide caption Takaichi was born and raised in the central Japanese prefecture of Nara. Her dad worked for an automotive firm, while her mom worked for the local police department. \"Unlike most or many of the politicians in her party who became prime ministers, she came from rather modest means,\" Hall says. \"But she did study very hard when she was young, and she passed the entrance exams for some very elite private universities in Japan.\" But he said Takaichi's parents refused to pay for her tuition to an elite university, preferring that she attend a two-year college to save money and live closer to home. She ended up attending Kobe University, a prestigious national university, paying her own way through part-time jobs and making the six-hour round-trip commute from her parents' house. In 1987, Takaichi moved to the U.S. to work as a congressional fellow in the office of Rep. Pat Schroeder , a Democrat from Colorado  despite her own conservative leanings, Hall notes. After returning to Japan, she was able to market herself as an expert in international politics and secure a job as a television presenter. \"And from there, she segued away from being a TV personality into a politician, which is a common path in Japan,\" Hall says. \"If you're famous on TV, you have a pretty good chance of winning elections.\" Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993, representing her hometown of Nara as an independent. She joined the LDP three years later and went on to serve in a number of key government positions, including minister of economic security. Notably, she served as the minister of international communications  which is responsible for telecommunications policy and broadcast media regulations  under the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, from 2014 to 2017 and again from 2019 to 2020. \"She served in that, I think, longer than any other politician has ever served, because the Abe administration was a very long administration and he valued her competency,\" Hall says. Abe was Japan's longest-serving prime minister, holding office from 2006 to 2007 and 2012 to 2020, before his assassination in 2022 . He was known for his efforts to revitalize Japan's economy  nicknamed \"Abenomics\"  and rebuild its role on the global stage. Takaichi \"definitely depicts herself as the successor to Abe's conservative legacy,\" Hall says, noting that she did get his endorsement in the party's 2021 leadership election. \"I'm not sure how close friends they were, but they definitely were on the same page ideologically when it came to issues like China and the revisionist view of World War II that many of the ultra-conservatives in Japan have,\" he said. Takaichi looks on as incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe speaks to the media in Tokyo in 2012. Yoshikazu TsunoAFP via Getty Images hide caption While she is not as traditionally fiscally conservative as others in her party, he says, she is extremely conservative on social issues. For instance, she wants to create programs to promote having children and doesn't think women should be allowed to keep their maiden names after marriage (even though she has used hers in professional and public life). She also has what Hall describes as hardline views on Japan's WWII history. In remarks over the years, she has downplayed Japan's aggression during the war and criticized the war crimes trials that the Allies held afterward to convict Japan's wartime leaders. Takaichi has been known to regularly visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, though she has recently refrained from doing so to avoid political and diplomatic backlash. Yasukuni is a controversial Shinto shrine that honors the spirits of Japan's war dead, including some convicted war criminals from World War II. Takaichi has also courted controversy with her disdain for immigrants and even tourists, a rapidly growing industry in Japan. While campaigning, she cited unconfirmed reports of tourists kicking sacred deer in Nara Park , part of a larger criticism of tourism that many saw as xenophobic. \"It also ties into a general dislike of foreign people and also immigrants who live in the country,\" Hall says. She has advocated for an anti-espionage law , suggesting that Chinese residents of Japan could be potential spies for China's government. During her campaign, she called for restrictions on non-Japanese people buying property in Japan and a crackdown on illegal immigration. \"People who are very anti-immigration are sort of smiling on her becoming prime minister, expecting that she will do something about it,\" Hall says, adding he thinks that is unlikely because of pressure from Japanese businesses who rely on immigration in the face of significant labor shortages . Takaichi holds a notable place in the history books as the first female prime minister of a country where women only held about 10 of seats in parliament as of 2024. Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in terms of gender equality  the lowest of any Group of Seven nation  according to the World Economic Forum (WEF)'s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report . However, Takaichi appears unlikely to prioritize issues of gender equality. She has long advocated for traditional gender roles, opposes same-sex marriage and supports male-only succession to the Japanese throne. \"This is not going to be a period when women's equality or other gender issues are aggressively advanced,\" Hall says. \"But there is, I guess, some benefit to having a woman as the leader of your country, to show  young women that in the future they could become prime minister, too.\" Takaichi has spoken about women's rights, specifically advocating for the expansion of hospital services for women's health and opening up about her own struggles with menopause symptoms. Takaichi has also spoken about her struggles to conceive; She has no biological children, but is a stepmother to three kids  and grandmother to four  from her husband's previous marriage. (She is married to former member of parliament and fellow LDP member Taku Yamamoto , who legally took her last name, a relative rarity in Japan.) Takaichi had promised on the campaign trail to increase the number of women in her cabinet to \" Nordic levels ,\" or closer to 50 . But in the hours after taking office, she appointed only two . Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi poses with her new cabinet members at the prime minister's office in Tokyo on Tuesday. She appointed two female cabinet members, despite her campaign promises to elevate their representation to \"Nordic levels.\" Kiyoshi OtaPool Bloomberg hide caption Hall says Takaichi has had to be more conservative than her male colleagues in order to take the helm of the party. While she and her role model Margaret Thatcher differ in their approaches to fiscal policy, he says both are conservative, hawkish and \"do not want to be seen as weak.\" \"She maybe, in a way, has modeled her rise on Margaret Thatcher by being this very strong figure, despite coming up in a party of very conservative men who generally do not promote women to the highest positions,\" he adds. Takaichi has indicated a friendliness toward President Trump, who called her \"a highly respected person of great wisdom and strength\" in a social media post earlier this month congratulating her on her rise to party leadership and her expected ascension to prime minister. She responded with a post of her own, writing in both English and Japanese that she is \"truly hoping to work together with President Trump to make our alliance even stronger  more prosperous, and to advance a Free and Open Indo-Pacific.\" Hall says Trump likely has a good first impression of Takaichi already, because of her reputation as an \"anti-immigration, hard-line conservative who is a respecter of his late friend Shinzo Abe.\" Abe was one of the first foreign leaders to cultivate a relationship with Trump during his first term. The two became friends as they bonded over wagyu beef burgers, sumo wrestling and golf. Trump is expected to meet Takaichi on a visit to Japan later this month. Hall predicts she will follow the same playbook as her predecessors: \"You be as nice as possible to the president, you show him the maximum respect, you do not have public disagreements with him,\" he says. \"And when you do disagree over policy, you do it in a very subtle way that doesn't seem like you're telling the president he's wrong.\"",

        "content": "Senator Ted Cruz of Texas sent a letter to the nonprofit operator of Wikipedia alleging a pattern of liberal bias in articles on the collaborative encyclopedia. \"I write to request information about ideological bias on the Wikipedia platform and at the Wikimedia Foundation,\" Cruz wrote to Wikimedia Foundation CEO Maryana Iskander in a letter dated October 3. \"Wikipedia began with a noble concept: Crowdsource human knowledge using verifiable sources and make it free to the public. That's what makes reports of Wikipedia's systemic bias especially troubling.\" Citing research from the conservative Manhattan Institute , Cruz wrote that researchers have found that articles on the site often reflect a left-wing bias. Cruz alleged that bias is particularly evident in Wikipedia's reliable sourcesperennial sources list because it describes MSNBC and CNN as 'generally reliable' sources, while listing Fox News as a generally unreliable source for politics and science. The left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center gets a top rating, but the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank, is a blacklisted and deprecated source that Wikipedias editors have determined promotes disinformation. Cruz asked for \"documents sufficient to show how the Wikimedia Foundation or the Wikipedia Community determines the categorization of sources on the reliable sourcesperennial sources list.\" A Wikipedia page says the categorization is determined through public discussion and consensus and that Fox News had its rating lowered in 2020 because Fox News downplayed the Covid-19 pandemic , because of allegations that it spread misinformation about climate change , and because it reported on the false concept of  no-go zones  for non-Muslims in British cities. Cruz accused the foundation of \"financially supporting left-wing organizations that contribute to Wikipedia content\" and said that \"a coordinated group of editors pushed antisemitic narratives on Wikipedia while whitewashing the activities of groups like Hamas.\" Wikipedia responded to edit wars on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by banning eight editors in January. Cruz acknowledged that the organization took action on the allegations of biased editing but questioned its motives. \"The Wikimedia Foundation has said it is taking steps to combat this editing campaign, raising further questions about the extent to which it is intervening in editorial decisions and to what end,\" Cruz wrote. The Wikimedia Foundation provided a statement when contacted by Ars Monday. \"We can confirm receipt of a letter from Senator Ted Cruz,\" the statement said. \"Wikipedia is supported by strong safeguards and high-quality volunteer oversight; it is a living encyclopedia that is always improving. We welcome the opportunity to further educate policymakers on the important work of Wikipedia, and the Wikimedia Foundation stands by its unwavering commitment to protect editors' exercise of free expression. Through rigorous policies, editorial standards, user privacy protections, and transparent processes, nearly 260,000 volunteers have created over 65 million articles in 300 languages. Wikipedia seeks to inform, not persuade.\" Cruz sent the letter about two weeks after criticizing Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr for threatening ABC with station license revocations over political content on Jimmy Kimmels show. Cruz said that using the government to dictate what the media can say \"will end up bad for conservatives\" because when Democrats are back in power, \"they will silence us, they will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly.\" Cruz said that Carr threatening ABC was like \"a mafioso coming into a bar going, 'Nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it.'\" Cruz, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, doesn't mind using his authority to pressure Wikipedia's operator, however. \"The Standing Rules of the Senate grant the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation jurisdiction over communications, including online information platforms,\" he wrote to the Wikimedia Foundation. \"As the Chairman of the Committee, I request that you provide written responses to the questions below, as well as requested documents, no later than October 17, 2025, and in accordance with the attached instructions.\" We asked Cruz's office to explain why a senator pressuring Wikipedia is appropriate while an FCC chair pressuring ABC is not and will update this article if we get a response. Among other requests, Cruz asked for \"documents sufficient to show what supervision, oversight, or influence, if any, the Wikimedia Foundation has over the editing community,\" and \"documents sufficient to show how the Wikimedia Foundation addresses political or ideological bias.\" Cruz has separately been launching investigations into the Biden administration for alleged censorship. He issued a report allegedly \"revealing how the Biden administration transformed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) into an agent of censorship pressuring Big Tech to police speech,\" and scheduled a hearing for Wednesday titled, \"Shut Your App: How Uncle Sam Jawboned Big Tech Into Silencing Americans.\" Cruz's letter to Wikimedia seeks evidence that could figure into his ongoing investigations into the Biden administration. \"Provide any and all documents and communicationsincluding emails, texts, or other digital messagesbetween any officer, employee, or agent of the Wikimedia Foundation and any officer, employee, or agent of the federal government since January 1, 2020,\" the letter said.

        "title": "Tinder Launches Mandatory Facial Verification to Weed Out Bots and Scammers",
        "content": "On Wednesday, Tinder announced that it is rolling out a mandatory facial verification tool for new users in the US to help combat the spread of fake profiles and weed out bad actors. Tinder claims its mandatory facial integration feature, called Face Check, is a first for a major dating app. During the sign-up process, new members complete a liveness check by taking a short video selfie within the app. The procedure collects and stores an encrypted map of information about the shape of the users face. We dont store a picture of your face, its not photo recognition , its data points about the shape of your face that are turned into a mathematical hash, says Yoel Roth, head of Trust and Safety for Match Group, which owns Tinder. Tinder then uses that hash to check whether a new sign-up matches an account that already exists on Tinder. Face Check is currently available to users in California, which will be followed by Texas and other states. In a news release , Roth said the measure sets a new benchmark for trust and safety across the dating industry and it helps tackle one of the hardest problems online, knowing whether someone is real  while adding meaningful obstacles that are difficult for bad actors to circumvent. The company defines bad actors as accounts that engage in deceptive behavior, including spamming, scamming, and bots. Currently 98 percent of the content moderation actions on Tinder address fake accounts, scamming, and spam. There is a significant volume of the overall trust and safety work we do on Tinder that is focused on this challenge. Roth says it is a meaningful improvement in our ability to address scaled abuse. You can get new phone numbers, new email addresses, new devicesyou can't really get a new face. The company is aware that asking new members to scan their faces might be seen as a privacy issue, but theoretically, if somebody were to get access to every single one of these hashes thats been created, there isn't really anything they could do. The apps previous verification methods were voluntary. Members, depending on their jurisdiction, could opt to verify their profiles through a selfie or ID process. Other dating apps like Bumble also use facial recognition software to let daters verify their authenticity, but on a voluntary basis. When asked what the app plans to do about the fake profiles that already exist, given Face Check applies only to new users, Roth says the tech is most effective in curbing the biggest issue that we're concerned with, which is the bulk creation of new accounts. As WIRED previously reported , people in the US have reported nearly 4.5 billion in romance and confidence fraud losses over the past decade, according to an analysis of the FBIs internet crime reports . Through romance scams, fraudsters, and catfishers create fake identities to woo people and get their money; both crypto and AI can help facilitate these scams. Tinder is undergoing an overhaul with new Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff at the helm. Rascoff, a venture capitalist who cofounded Zillow, took the reins of Match Group in February and within months laid off 13 percent of the companys workforce. Though Rascoff oversees Match Groups entire portfoliowhich includes Hinge, OkCupid, The League, Plenty of Fish, and othershe also runs operations at Tinder. According to the company, early results of Face Checkcreated in partnership with the global 3D face liveness and matching software company FaceTechave led to considerable a decline in potential harm from romance scammers. The tech is already available in Colombia, Canada, Australia, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. Tinder claims there has been a 40 percent decrease in bad actor reports. The company is committed to responsible innovation, Rascoff said in a news release . Tinder was the big bang of dating apps when it launched in 2012, introducing singles to an era of endless swipes and revolutionizing the dating landscape. Today, however, young people spend less time online swiping for love. In 2024, millennials spent an average of 56 minutes a day on dating apps (down from 90 minutes in 2018). According to a WIRED investigation , Tinder has taken a considerable hit when it comes to where singles spend their time. While total dating app downloads worldwide have remained above 120 million annually since 2020, the Tinder slice of that download pie has gotten smaller, WIRED reported this year. In 2024, the app experienced a 7 percent decline in paying users, according to Business Insider. Starting next year, Match Group said, it plans to roll out Face Check across other apps in its portfolio. Compared to dating apps, Roth says, the balance of privacy is different on a platform focused on speech. In the context of apps that are built to connect people in the real world, we think that theres not only a moral imperative but a business imperative to prioritize and build for safety.",

        "title": "Historians Don't Think a US Civil War Is Likely—but They're Still Nervous",
        "content": "Things look a little different in the US these days. Leaves are turning, the football stadiums are full, and children are planning their trick-or-treating routes; there are also masked men snatching people off the streets, while the US military has had boots on the ground in four major cities, another state, and the nations capital. Last week, Illinois governor JB Pritzker went on national television and suggested federal immigration agents can be held legally accountable for how they conduct themselves. Elected officials such as Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia have spoken openly about a  national divorce . Its impossible to look around and not wonder whether the US is teetering on the brink though of what, is the question. Ordinary, reasonable people are openly talking about whether the country is on the verge of something comparable to a slow-rolling civil conflict, if not something worse. Theyre not alone. Historians of those conflicts are worried. Theyre not concerned about a full-blown civil war, featuring rival divisions of the US Army staging set-piece battles over territory, but something else that even the experts have a hard time putting their finger on. Familiar frameworks, like the US Civil War or the Troubles in Northern Ireland, probably present too square a peg for the present round hole. Im creating a new hole for the peg, says Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who has been studying political violence for the past three decades. Since 2022, hes been working on a new concept he calls violent populism, which he thinks could better represent the countrys current moment. He describes it as something between civil war and nasty politics as usual. In violent populism, there is a certain level of demand foror acceptance ofviolence. Real-life examples can range from January 6 rioters who battered police officers to Luigi Mangione superfans calling for the executions of executives. President Trumps actions count here too, Pape says: It doesnt help matters that the Trump administration continues to refer to its political opposition as enemy combatants or uses explicitly violent and militaristic language to describe the current moment. What Trump is doing is creating more and more permission structures for people to carry out violence for his goals, Pape says, pointing to the pardoning and sentence commutations of January 6 rioters and the presidents encouragement of military generals to be more aggressive by using American cities as a training ground to fight the enemy from within. Cranking up the temperature in a way that effectively encourages violence doesnt necessarily require any explicit orders or stated wishes, Pape says. That comes with the constant us versus them mentality: Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, put the administration line succinctly last Thursday when she said, \"The Democrat Party's main constituency are made up of Hamas terrorists, illegal aliens, and violent criminals.\" (The White House did not return a request for comment.) But is all of this enough to cause serious civil unrest? It very well could, but the situation has enough uniquely modern and dystopian elements that its worth considering all the different potential outcomes, experts say. Despite the Trump administrations best efforts to depict antifa as a growing left-wing insurgency, it is not. There doesnt currently appear to be any organized paramilitary formation carrying out routine acts of violence with the stated goal of overthrowing the US government. This makes our moment distinct from the 1960s and 1970s , when bombings and civil unrest felt like a weekly occurrence. In recent decades, most calls for violence in the US have originated from far-right extremists . Experts draw a line from the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that killed 168 people to more current far-right movements and calls for violence. Still, politically motivated groups have committed all sorts of violence, or promised revenge, in relatively recent memory without resulting in large-scale armed conflict. The US had one civil war, and it had decade after decade of paramilitary politics and people being murdered at polling booths and people believing every election was the end of the world and the end of the country, says Greg Downs, a Civil War historian and history department chair at UC Davis. Even if there were any desire for civil unrest on the leftsomething for which there is no evidencethe modern surveillance state would seemingly make it almost impossible to carry out. Everybody is on camera all the time, whether its because of Ring doorbell cameras or cell phones or highway traffic monitorslet alone drones and security cameras and stuff like that, says Seth Rosenfeld, the author of Subversives , a history of the FBIs war on student radicals. If somebody were to try and mount a revolution, before they could really get going they would need to address all of these security concerns. Can you really have a civil war in a country with a nuclear arsenal? Downs asks. Can you really have a civil war in a country with Black Hawk helicopters and all of the things that they can bring to bear? And even with social media and all the rest of our modern-day technology, it might not be so easy to even realize weve entered a period of civil conflict. It certainly wasnt for Americans in the 1850s and early 1860s. Most Americans were stunned at the turn of events, Manisha Sinha, a Civil War historian and the Draper Chair in American History at the University of Connecticut, tells me. She doesnt like all of this talk about a civil war today, she says, because it can lead to a sense of inevitability. But when it went down for real at the Battle of Bull Run in Virginia in 1861, much of the American public saw the likelihood of an actual war as anything but inevitable. Pape noted that onlookers brought picnic materials to Bull Run because nobody thought it was going to be a serious civil war  When this thing was getting going, it was a joke. So what should people be taking seriously? And when? The most significant aspect of what were currently dealing with, both the historians and several Democratic operatives told me, is the possible use of military personnel for law enforcement purposes. This has been generally illegal since the late 19th century; the most notable instrument that would authorize its use is the Insurrection Act of 1807, which Trump has repeatedly threatened to use . One Democratic operative told me they dont worry about anyone taking up arms over increased military involvement, but the images of ICE and troops in the streets alone give them great pause because of the fear they can instill in the public. We are absolutely in the beginnings of some kind of, maybe civil war is not the right term, but the fabric of what binds America together at this point is basically on its final thread, this Democratic source says, requesting anonymity to speak candidly without involving their clients in New York politics. In Americas relatively short history, the country has a robust track record of presidents and governors utilizing the troops at their disposallegally, usuallyto tamp down on civil unrest. There is a potential for calamity with the politically fueled deployment of military troops to do police work, Rosenfeld says, describing a horrific incident from 1969, during the Peoples Park protests on a parcel of land owned by UC Berkeley. A state of extreme emergency declared by then-California governor Ronald Reagan enabled the deployment of the National Guard to quash student demonstrations against the Vietnam War and other issues, after Alameda County Sheriff deputies ran out of bird-shot pellets for their guns and switched to buckshot, a thicker and more lethal set of shells. James Rector, a 25-year-old bystander, was watching the action unfold from a bookstore rooftop when he was shot by police, dying from his wounds days later. Dozens of others were wounded from either the buckshot rounds or by more conventional means, mainly billy clubs. \"We either had to use shotguns, Alameda County sheriff Frank Madigan said at the time, or retreat and surrender the city to the mob.\" The response to what became known as Bloody Thursday got so out of hand that helicopters dropped CS gasa more intense form of tear gas, the same one used by the FBI against the Branch Davidians at Wacoonto the protesters. Wind pushed it into a hospital. This is where Matt OBrien, an Ohio-based historian specializing in 20th century Ireland, sees a similarity to the Troubles: the use in cities of out-of-state National Guard troops and formations from the Department of Homeland Security, who do not have the same training as law enforcement or familiarity with the arenas in which they are deployed. A lot of the British soldiers sent over to Northern Ireland were 18-, 19-year-old kids from Liverpool and from Birmingham, OBrien says. Some of them were of Irish descent, and they were expected to carry out police duties, and they were woefully unprepared. For Pape, the uniquely American and Trumpian nature of the problem makes it harder for us to grasp. Or, at least, harder to grasp compared to those seeing this unfold from abroad. I think its basically hard for everyone hereand Id put myself in this tooto get analytic distance when the violence is happening right in our country, right next door, says Pape. With things so dire, I want to end on a positive note. I reached out to Bill Ayers to talk me through this moment. Ayers knows a thing or two about militant armed resistance from his time in the Weather Underground during the 1970s, and just how dangerous it can get. His group, which opposed the Vietnam War and viewed the US government as an imperialist entity, targeted federal buildings with homemade bombs in the 1960s and 1970s. Three members of the Weather Underground were killed in an accidental explosion in 1970. Ayers was a fugitive for the next decade before he and his wife turned themselves in around the time that the federal charges against them were dropped. He ended up becoming a professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago. Despite everything he went through, and everything he did, Ayers says protesters and organizers still stand a chance in this moment without needing to resort to violence.",

        "title": "Astronomers Have Discovered Earth’s Latest Quasi-Lunar Moon",
        "content": "The Earth has just added its seventh confirmed quasi-lunar moon. It is 2025 PN7, a small Apollo-type asteroid detected in August solely by its brightness, thanks to the Hawaiian Pan-STARRS 1 telescope. After analyzing its trajectory, scientists concluded that the object maintains a 1:1 resonance with the Earth. In other words, it orbits the sun at the same time as our planet. From a distant perspective, this synchronicity makes it look as if the Earth is accompanied by a tiny asteroidas if it had an additional moon. Unlike the moon, quasi-lunar moons are not gravitationally bound to the Earth . They are ephemeral companions, in cosmological terms, following their own path around the sun. Only at certain times do they come close enough to appear bound. In the case of 2025 PN7, its minimum distance is 299,000 kilometers, while at its farthest point it can reach 17 million km. For comparison, the moon remains at an average distance of 384,000 km from Earth. According to the article published in Research Notes of the AAS , the asteroid has been in a quasi-satellite phase since 1965, and is expected to remain so for 128 years. Some researchers estimate that 2025 PN7 will finally move away in 2083. So far, seven bodies have been confirmed that appear to accompany the planet in its orbit. Astronomers believe that more may be discovered in the future. Earth is a natural reservoir of quasi-lunars because the Earth's orbit is similar to that of certain nearby objects that inhabit the so-called Arjuna group of asteroids, a population that has only recently begun to be studied in greater detail. The Arjuna group does not form a ring like the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, but comprises a legion of near-Earth rocks that orbit the sun on a similar path as our planet. Occasionally, some of these asteroids coincide with our trajectory and, depending on their orbital dynamics, are classified as quasi-lunar or mini moons. The main difference between the two categories is that quasi-lunar moons orbit the sun together with the planet. Mini moons, on the other hand, do go around the Earth, but usually in a horseshoe-type orbital motion. In addition, mini moons appear for brief periods of weeks or months before they move on forever. The seven known quasi-lunar moons belong to the Arjuna group and share a 1:1 resonance with the Earth's orbit. They are: 164207 Cardea, 277810, 2013 LX28, 2014 OL339, 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, 2023 FW13 and 2025 PN7. The Pan-STARRS observatory has established itself as one of the leading detectors of near-Earth objects. Its list of findings includes quasi-lunar moons, comets, and even supernovae, thanks to a 1.4 billion-pixel digital camera, the largest of its kind in the world. In astronomy, there are different ways to acquire a moon. Some planets, such as Jupiter or Saturn, capture bodies orbiting close to them. Others, like Earth, formed their satellites after collisions in the infancy of the solar system. In any case, the essential rule is clear: To qualify as a real-deal moon, a satellite must be permanently bound to the planet's gravity.",

        "title": "Top US Election Security Watchdog Forced to Stop Election Security Work",
        "content": "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has frozen all of its election security work and is reviewing everything it has done to help state and local officials secure their elections for the past eight years, WIRED has learned. The move represents the first major example of the countrys cyberdefense agency accommodating President Donald Trumps false claims of election fraud and online censorship. In a memo sent Friday to all CISA employees and obtained by WIRED, CISAs acting director, Bridget Bean, said she was ordering a review and assessment of every position at the agency related to election security and countering mis- and disinformation , as well as every election security and mis-, dis-, and malinformation product, activity, service, and program that has been carried out since the federal government designated election systems as critical infrastructure in 2017. CISA will pause all elections security activities until the completion of this review, Bean added. The agency is also cutting off funding for these activities at the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing  Analysis Center , a group funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that has served as a coordinating body for the elections community. In her memo, Bean confirmed that CISA had, as first reported by Politico , placed employees initially identified to be associated with the elections security activities and the MDM program on administrative leave on February 7. It is necessary to rescope the agency's election security activities to ensure CISA is focused exclusively on executing its cyber and physical security mission, she told employees in the memo. While Bean is temporarily leading CISA, she is officially the agencys executive director, its top career position. CISAs first director created the executive-director role to provide continuity during political transitions. Previously, Bean was a Trump appointee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency during his first term. In justifying CISAs internal review, which will conclude on March 6, Bean pointed to Trumps January 20 executive order on ending federal censorship. Conservatives have argued that CISA censored their speech by coordinating with tech companies to identify online misinformation in 2020, during the final year of Trumps first term. CISA has denied conducting any censorship, and the US Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit over the governments work. But in the wake of the backlash, CISA halted most conversations with tech platforms about online mis- and disinformation. CISA and DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since 2017, state and local election officials have relied on CISAs expertise and resourcesas well as its partnerships with other agenciesto improve their physical and digital security. Through on-site consultations and online guidance, CISA has helped election administrators secure voting infrastructure against hackers, harden polling places against active shooters, and create polling-place backup plans to deal with ballot shortages or power outages. Election supervisors have always struggled to overcome serious funding challenges, but in recent years, their jobs have become even more stressful as intense voter scrutiny has given way to harassment and even death threats . Election officials of both parties have repeatedly praised CISA for its apolitical support of their work, saying the agencys recommendations and free security services have been critical in boosting their own efforts. But that bipartisan accord began fraying after the 2020 election, as some conservative election officials started criticizing the agency for its focus on mis- and disinformation. Congressional Republicans joined the fray as well, calling CISA the nerve center of the federal governments domestic surveillance and censorship operations on social media. Their rhetoric echoed Trumps own history of election denialism , which involved false claims of rigged voting machines and mass voter fraud and culminated in Trump supporters January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. With conservatives pushing to axe CISAs election security mission, Trumps election last November virtually guaranteed an end to that program , and employees have been bracing for retaliation against the people who participated in that work. Beans memo indicates that CISAs internal review will cover every agency position related to election security, as well as performance plans for employees involved in that work; all support services provided to the election community; and all election security guidance and publications. Bean wrote that CISA will describe any steps necessary to correct any activities identified as past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech, including eliminating programs or roles. After CISA completes its review, the agency will submit a report to the White House addressing how it plans to deliver a more focused provision of services for elections security activities, Bean told employees. The report will focus on three goals: streamlining the election security services that CISA offers to state and local governments, ensuring that its activities align with its new mandate to refocus on its core mission, and removing all personnel, contracts, grants, programs, products, services, and activities that conflict with Trumps anti-censorship directive or exceed CISAs authorities. It is unclear if White House officials or DHS secretary Kristi Noem directly ordered Bean to launch the election security investigation or if she independently determined that Trumps executive order necessitated it. The January 20 directive does instruct the attorney general to work with other agency leaders to investigate Biden-administration activities that are inconsistent with Trumps vow to end online censorship, but it makes no mention of activities prior to Bidens term, including CISAs 2020 election work.",

        "title": "Geek Power: Steven Levy Revisits Tech Titans, Hackers, Idealists",
        "content": "It's funny in a way, says Bill Gates, relaxing in an armchair in his office. \"When I was young, I didn't know any old people. When we did the microprocessor revolution, there was nobody old, nobody. It's weird how old this industry has become.\" The Microsoft cofounder and I, a couple of fiftysomething codgers, are following up on an interview I had with a tousle-headed Gates more than a quarter century ago . I was trying to capture what I thought was the red-hot core of the then-burgeoning computer revolutionthe scarily obsessive, absurdly brainy, and endlessly inventive people known as hackers. Back then, Gates had just pulled off a deal to supply his DOS operating system to IBM. His name was not yet a household word; even Word was not yet a household word. I would interview Gates many times over the years, but that first conversation was special. I saw his passion for computers as a matter of historic import. Gates himself saw my reverence as an intriguing novelty. But by then I was convinced that I was documenting a movement that would affect everybody. The book I was writing, Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution , came out just over 25 years ago, in the waning days of 1984. My editor had urged me to be ambitious, and so I shot high, crafting a 450-page narrative in three parts, making the case that hackersbrilliant programmers who discovered worlds of possibility within the coded confines of a computerwere the key players in a sweeping digital transformation. I hadn't expected to reach that conclusion. When I embarked on my project, I thought of hackers as little more than an interesting subculture. But as I researched them, I found that their playfulness, as well as their blithe disregard for what others said was impossible, led to the breakthroughs that would define the computing experience for millions of people. Early MIT hackers realized it was possible to use computers for what we now call word processing. (Their initial program was called Expensive Typewriter, appropriate since the one machine it ran on cost 120,000.) They also invented the digital videogame. The rebel engineers of the Homebrew Computer Club in Silicon Valley were the first to take advantage of new low-cost chips to build personal computers. They may have begun as a fringe cohort, but hackers alchemized the hard math of Moore's law into a relentless series of technological advances that changed the world and touched all of our lives. And most of them did it simply for the joy of pulling off an awesome trick. But behind the inventiveness was something even more marvelousall real hackers shared a set of values that has turned out to be a credo for the information age. I attempted to codify this unspoken ethos into a series of principles called the hacker ethic . Some of the notions now seem forehead-smackingly obvious but at the time were far from accepted (\"You can create art and beauty on a computer\"). Others spoke to the meritocratic possibilities of a digital age (\"Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position\"). Another axiom identified computers as instruments of insurrection, granting power to any individual with a keyboard and sufficient brainpower (\"Mistrust authoritypromote decentralization\"). But the precept I perceived as most central to hacker culture turned out to be the most controversial: \"All information should be free.\" Stewart Brand, hacker godfather and Whole Earth Catalog founder, hacked even that statement. It happened at the first Hackers' Conference, the week my book was published, during a session I moderated on the future of the hacker ethic. \"On the one hand, information wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable,\" he said. \"On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.\" His words neatly encapsulate the tension that has since defined the hacker movementa sometimes pitched battle between geeky idealism and icy-hearted commerce. Though Hackers initially landed with a bit of a thud ( The New York Times called it \"a monstrously overblown magazine article\"), it eventually found an audience greater than even my overheated expectations. Through chance encounters, email, and tweets, people are constantly telling me that reading the book inspired them in their careers. Thumbing through David Kushner's Masters of Doom , I learned that reading Hackers as a geeky teenager reassured Doom creator John Carmack that he was not alone in the world. When I recently interviewed Ben Fried, Google's chief information officer, he showed up with a dog-eared copy of the book for me to sign. \"I wouldn't be here today if I hadn't read this,\" he told me. But it was the hackers themselves who inspired a generation of programmers, thinkers, and entrepreneursand not just fellow techies. Everyone who has ever used a computer has benefited. The Internet itself exists thanks to hacker idealsits expansion was lubricated by a design that enabled free access. The word hacker entered the popular lexicon, although its meaning has changed: In the mid-'80s, following a rash of computer break-ins by teenagers with personal computers, true hackers stood by in horror as the general public began to equate the wordtheir wordwith people who used computers not as instruments of innovation and creation but as tools of thievery and surveillance. The kind of hacker I wrote about was motivated by the desire to learn and build, not steal and destroy. On the positive side of the ledger, this friendly hacker type has also become a cultural iconthe fuzzy, genial whiz kid who wields a keyboard to get Jack Bauer out of a jam, or the brainy billionaire in a T-shirteven if today he's more likely to be called a geek. The Hackers: Digital Revolutionaries, the Early Years: 1, 5: Bill Gates, cofounder of Microsoft; 2: Richard Stallman, leader of the GNU Project and founder of the Free Software Foundation; 3: Steve Wozniak, developer of the Apple II computer; 4, 6: Lee Felsenstein, creator of the Osborne 1 computer; 7: Paul Graham, cocreator of Viaweb and cofounder of Y Combinator. In the last chapters of Hackers , I focused on the threat of commercialism, which I feared would corrupt the hacker ethic. I didn't anticipate that those ideals would remake the very nature of commerce. Yet the fact that the hacker ethic spread so widelyand mingled with mammon in so many waysguaranteed that the movement, like any subculture that breaks into the mainstream, would change dramatically. So as Hackers was about to appear in a new edition (this spring, O'Reilly Media is releasing a reprint, including the first digital version), I set out to revisit both the individuals and the culture. Like the movie Broken Flowers , in which Bill Murray embarks on a road trip to search out his former girlfriends, I wanted to extract some meaning from seeing what had happened to my subjects over the years, hoping their experiences would provide new insights as to how hacking has changed the worldand vice versa. I could visit only a small sample, but in their examples I found a reflection of how the tech world has developed over the past 25 years. While the hacker movement may have triumphed, not all of the people who created it enjoyed the same fate. Like Gates, some of my original subjects are now rich, famous, and powerful. They thrived in the movement's transition from insular subculture to multibillion-dollar industry, even if it meant rejecting some of the core hacker tenets. Others, unwilling or unable to adapt to a world that had discovered and exploited their passionor else just unluckytoiled in obscurity and fought to stave off bitterness. I also found a third group: the present-day heirs to the hacker legacy, who grew up in a world where commerce and hacking were never seen as opposing values. They are bringing their worldview into fertile new territories and, in doing so, are molding the future of the movement. Real hackers don't take vacations. And by that standard, Bill Gates is no longer a real hacker. Gates himself admits as much. \"I believe in intensity, and I have to agree totally; by objective measures my intensity in my teens and twenties was more extreme,\" he says. \"In my twenties, I just worked. Now I go home for dinner. When you choose to get married and have kids, if you're going to do it well you are going to give up some of the fanaticism.\" Indeed, looking back, Gates says that the key period of his hackerhood came even earlier. \"The hardcore years, the most fanatical years, are 13 to 16,\" he says. \"So you were over the hill by the time you got to Harvard?\" I ask. \"In terms of programming 24 hours a day? Oh yeah,\" he says. \"Certainly by the time I was 17 my software mind had been shaped.\" He still seemed plenty intense when I met him as a 27-year-old, brash but not given to making direct eye contact. For half of the interview, he stared at a computer screen, testing software with one of those newfangled mouses. But he engaged fully with my questions, rattling off his highly opinionated take on some of the people he worked withand againstin the early days of the PC. That intensity would inform his work and his company, helping him turn Microsoft into a software behemoth and himself into the richest human being on the planet (for quite a while, anyway). Gates' faith in hacking underscored everything he did, right down to his staffing decisions. \"If you want to hire an engineer,\" he says, look at the guy's code. That's all. If he hasn't written a lot of code, don't hire him. Gates occupies a special place in the history of hacking. Most consider him one of the best coders ever. His first version of Basic, written so efficiently that it could run in the 4-KB memory space of the Altair, was a marvel. (Yes, that's 4 kilo bytes, not mega, giga, or today's darling, tera.) When people picture a computer geek, they typically think of someone like the young Gates. And yet Gates, along with several other subjects of my book, went on to transcend his hacker roots. This group helped turn hacking from an obscure vocation into a global economic and cultural force and then reaped the rewards of that transition: money, influence, and even fame. This wouldn't have happened if Gates had been just another hacker. Indeed, it was only by discarding key aspects of the hacker ethic that he was able to embrace computing's commercial potential and bring it to the masses. Pure hackers encouraged anyone to copy, examine, and improve any piece of code. But Gates insisted that software was no different from other intellectual property and that copying a digital product was just as illegal as swiping a shirt from Kmart. In 1976, he wrote an open letter to computer hobbyists who copied his software, accusing them of theft. His missive was considered blasphemous by some hackers, who believed that Gates was polluting their avocation by introducing commercial restrictions that would stifle knowledge and creativity. Gates found these arguments ludicrousthis was a business, after all. \"I raised the issue in the sense of, jeez, if people paid more for software, I'd be able to hire more people,\" he says more than 30 years later. That conflict continues to rage. Gates puts the argument in perspective by pointing out that centuries ago, European publishers printed American writers' works without compensation. \"Benjamin Franklin was so ripped offhe could have written exactly what I wrote in that letter,\" he says. Today, journalists are trying to figure out how to sustain their business when their product can be copied and distributed so easilyit's the same dynamic. Gates seems to take some satisfaction in this turn of events. \"Maybe magazine writers will still get paid 20 years from now,\" he says to me. \"Or maybe you'll have to cut hair during the day and just write articles at night. Who knows?\" The Hackers: Digital Revolutionaries, the Early Years: 1: Lee Felsenstein, creator of the Osborne 1 computer; 2, 6: Richard Greenblatt, pioneering member of MIT's coder elite; 3: Richard Stallman, leader of the GNU Project and founder of the Free Software Foundation; 4: Tim O'Reilly, computer book publisher; 5, 9: Andy Hertzfeld, designer of the first Macintosh OS; 8: Steve Wozniak, developer of the Apple II computer; 10: Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook. Gates had to stray from the hackers' rigid moral code to become a mainstream success. All Steve Wozniak had to do was don a pair of dancing shoes : While Woz is a hacker legend, best known for designing the original Apple computer, he has become an unlikely pop culture icon, turning up last year on Dancing With the Stars . When I met up with him, he had just reunited with the other contestants for the season finale. \"I was dancing against Jerry Springer and Cloris Leachman,\" he says over chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant in Fremont, California. His early elimination in no way dampened his spirits. Very little dampens Woz's spirits, even the fact that reality TV celebrity is overshadowing his genuine accomplishments in technology: \"People come up to me and say, 'Omigod, I saw you on Dancing With the Stars !' I have to say, 'Well, I did computers, too.'\" Casual fans can be forgiven for overlooking Woz's tech cred. These days, he's more likely to get attention for his unique hobbies (Segway polo, anyone?) or love life (he had a sign-of-the-apocalypse romance with comedian Kathy Griffin, although he has since married a woman he met on a geek cruise) than for any new innovation. Snarky Web sites have mercilessly mocked Woz's celebrity-mag turns and frequent appearances in an Apple store's first-day lines as indications of sad irrelevance. But Woz shrugs off the ribbing. He recalls the instruction he gave to Griffin a few years ago: \"Hey, you can embarrass me, you can abuse me, you can ridicule me as much as you wantif it makes people laugh it's worth it.\" When I profiled Woz in my book, he was a socially awkward and insecure millionaire. Now he is a confident and widely loved mascot for hacking culture at large. From time to time, Woz still appears in the news as a force behind a startup with potentially groundbreaking technology. CL 9 was going to devise superpowerful remote controls. Wheels of Zeus promised to let users track their possessions through wireless technology. But the first never lived up to expectations, and the second never released a product. Now he works as chief scientist for a storage company called Fusion-io. \"I'm doing a lot of sales-marketing work,\" he says. \"But I'm also looking at technologies that might be competitive in the future.\" People come up to me and say, Omigod, I saw you on Dancing With the Stars ! Steve Wozniak explains. I have to say, Well, I did computers, too. But even Woz doesn't expect to create another Apple II. In 2010, his greatest contribution is as a role model. His universal renown is a continuing reminder that brains and creativity can trump traditional notions of coolness. He's the nerd in the computer room whose statureand happinessfar eclipses that of aging prom kings. And that's an inspiration for nerds everywhere. Indeed, one of his protégé, Andy Hertzfeld, remains inspired by hacking. Hertzfeld wasn't a major figure in my book, but as one of Apple's early employees and a designer of the Macintosh operating system, he could have been. Today he's at Google, where his most visible contribution thus far is a feature that creates chronologies for Google News queries, so users can see how a story has developed over time. But hacking in your fifties isn't as easy as it is in your twenties. \"When I was hacking on the Mac, I'd be working away and think an hour had passed; then I'd look up, and it had been four hours,\" Hertzfeld says. \"Now when I think an hour has gone by, I look up and it's an hour.\" It's not just the passage of years that has changed Hertzfeld's experience. He has also had to adapt his individualistic approach to serve the geek-industrial complex that is Google. On one hand, Google is a hacker mecca. It values engineers as its most important assets. \"You are expected to work out of your passion,\" Hertzfeld saysdefinitely a hacker-friendly value. And the company supports open source software. But Hertzfeld can't duck the fact that Google is also a big company with rigid standards and processes for designing products, which makes the experience more formal and less fun. \"My relationship to my work is that of an artist to his work,\" he says. And at Google, he adds, \"I can't exercise my creativity in a way that gives me joy, which is my basic approach.\" But while he has lost some personal control, he has gained an unprecedented ability to make a mark on the world. Someone at Google can affect the lives of millions with a few lines of code. And that makes for a different kind of thrill than Hertzfeld experienced during Apple's early days, when the potential of every product was unknown and limitless. \"There's so much more leverage now to make a big impact,\" he says. \"This stuff is as mainstream as can be. Google, the iPhonethese move the culture more than the Beatles did in the '60s. It's shaping the human race.\" Richard Greenblatt tells me he has a rant to deliver. Uh-oh. Greenblatt was the canonical hacker of MIT's Project MACthe forerunner to the school's legendary AI Labin the early '60s. In my book, I described how his fellow MIT hackers, appalled at his hygiene, used the term milliblatts to gauge olfactory unpleasantness. It wasn't exactly flattering. Was he finally going to unload on me after all these years? To my relief, Greenblatt is more concerned with what he views as the decrepit state of computing. He hates how the dominant coding languages, like HTML and C, are being implemented. He misses LISP , the beloved language that he worked with back at MIT. \"The world is screwed up,\" he says before launching into a technical analysis of the current condition of programming that I can't even hope to follow. But coding is just the beginning. The real problem, Greenblatt says, is that business interests have intruded on a culture that was founded on the ideals of openness and creativity. In Greenblatt's heyday, he and his friends shared code freely, devoting themselves purely to the goal of building better products. \"There's a dynamic now that says, let's format our Web page so people have to push the button a lot so that they'll see lots of ads,\" Greenblatt says. \"Basically, the people who win are those who manage to make things the most inconvenient for you.\" Greenblatt is not one of those people. He belongs in a different group: the true believers, who still cling to their original motivationsthe joy of discovery, the free exchange of ideaseven as their passion has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. Despite their brilliance and importance, they never launched million-dollar products or became icons. They just kept hacking. I am surrounded by similar idealists here at the 25th Hackers' Conference, an annual gathering that celebrates the thrill of building something really cool. It has been a few years since I last attended, but it's just as I remember it: 48 hours of hackers meeting deep into the night at a Northern California resort, discussing everything from economic theory to data storage. The crowd is somewhat long in the tooth, despite an overdue effort to bring in more attendees under age 30. The tech industry may be filled with young geniuses, but the old guys are still going at it, even if most of their efforts remain blithely obscure. Greenblatt is a regular here, a link to the Mesopotamia of hacker culture: MIT. He arrived at the school just after the members of its Tech Model Railroad Club gained access to a rare interactive computer. Greenblatt became one of the best, a brilliant coder whose accomplishments include a sophisticated LISP compiler and one of the first autonomous computer chess programs. At MIT, he was known as a hacker's hacker. But unlike Gates, Wozniak, or Hertzfeld, Greenblatt's work never went mainstream. In the 1980s, he started a company to build LISP machines. It didn't pan out. He wasn't much of a businessperson. These days, he describes himself as an independent researcher. He moved into his mother's house in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to take care of her and has lived there alone since she died in 2005. \"The main project I've been working on for 15 years is called thread memory, and it has something to do with English-language comprehension stuff,\" he says. \"It's basic research. It's not something that works today, but it's something.\" When Greenblatt looks at the current state of hacking, he sees a fallen world. Even the word itself has lost its meaning. \"They stole our word,\" he says, \"and it's irretrievably gone.\" Greenblatt is far from alone in his wistful invocation of the past. I first met Richard Stallman, a denizen of MIT's AI Lab, in 1983. Even then he was bemoaning the sad decline of hacker culture and felt that the commercialization of software was a crime. When I spoke to him that year, as the computer industry was soaring, he looked me in the eye and said, \"I don't believe that software can be owned.\" I called him \"the last of the true hackers\" and assumed the world would soon squash him. Was I ever wrong. Stallman's crusade for free software has continued to inform the ongoing struggles over intellectual property and won him a MacArthur Foundation \"genius grant.\" He founded the Free Software Foundation and wrote the GNU operating system, which garnered widespread adoption after Linus Torvalds wrote Linux to run with it; the combination is used in millions of devices. More important, perhaps, is that Stallman provided the intellectual framework that led to the open source movement , a critical element of modern software and the Internet itself. If the software world had saints, Stallman would have been beatified long ago. Yet he is almost as famous for his unyielding personality. In 2002, Creative Commons evangelist Lawrence Lessig wrote, \"I don't know Stallman well. I know him well enough to know he is a hard man to like.\" (And that was in the preface to Stallman's own book.) Time has not softened him. In our original interview, Stallman said, \"I'm the last survivor of a dead culture. And I don't really belong in the world anymore. And in some ways I feel I ought to be dead.\" Now, meeting over Chinese food, he reaffirms this. \"I have certainly wished I had killed myself when I was born,\" he says. \"In terms of effect on the world, it's very good that I've lived. And so I guess, if I could go back in time and prevent my birth, I wouldn't do it. But I sure wish I hadn't had so much pain.\" That pain came in part from loneliness, once a common complaint among the tiny and obsessive cadre of computer fans. (A 1980 commentary by Stanford psychologist Philip Zimbardo implied that hackers were antisocial losers who turned to computers to avoid human contact.) But as hacker culture has spread, so has its social acceptability. Today, computer geeks are seen not as losers but as moguls in the making. They tend not to suffer the intense isolation that once plagued Stallmanthanks, ironically, to the commercialization he so bemoans. As much now as 25 years ago, Stallman is a fundamentalist, a Hutterite of hackerism. His personal Web site is a grab bag of appeals for people to boycott various enemies of the cause, from Blu-ray to J. K. Rowling. He even feuds with his former allies, including Torvalds. (\"He doesn't want to defend users' freedom,\" Stallman says.) He has particular contempt for Apple, with its closed systems and digital rights software. He refers to their products using Mad-magazine-style puns. The music player is an iScrod. Its mobile device is an iGroan. The new tablet computer is the iBad. And he is an equal-opportunity kvetcher. When I tell him that Hackers will soon be available for the Kindlewhich Stallman, predictably, calls a Swindlehis dour demeanor evaporates as he energetically encourages me to resist the e-reader's onerous DRM. \"You have to believe that freedom is important and you deserve it,\" he says. Despite his disillusionment, the fire still burns within him. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that his company promotes hacker values. Lee Felsenstein is keeping the flame alive as well. Felsenstein was the subversive moderator of the Homebrew Computer Club , the PC industry launchpad whose membersincluding Wozwere the target of Gates' letter. A veteran of the Berkeley free speech protests, Felsenstein thought that putting cheap computers in the hands of \"the people\" would allow everyone to take information, manipulate it to better reflect the truth, and distribute it widely. He was right about the rise of the PC, but he says he's still waiting for its democratizing effect. \"Lincoln Steffens once commented, 'I have seen the future, and it works,'\" Felsenstein says. \"But I'm with the guy who changed that to 'I have seen the future, and it needs work.'\" On a personal level, Felsenstein's career has been checkered. He was celebrated for the Osborne 1 computer, but the company went bust. So did Interval Research, where Felsenstein worked for eight years. \"If I wanted to, I could be bitter about it,\" he says. \"But I don't want to.\" Instead, Felsenstein is putting the next generation of geeks on the path of the righteous. He recently helped establish a workspace in Mountain View, California, called the Hacker Dojo, which charges each of its 80 members 100 a month for access to a fully stocked, 9,500-square-foot DIY shop with an in-house network. It's one of several \"hacker spaces\" across the countryoutposts devoted to empowering formerly isolated and underequipped gearheads. \"I am a sensei of the dojo,\" he says, a wide grin on his face. \"Felsenstein sensei.\" Greenblatt, Stallman, and Felsenstein see hacking as a set of ideals. But Paul Graham sees it as a humming economic engine. The 45-year-old Internet guru, himself a fanatic engineer in his day, is a cofounder of Y Combinator, an incubator for Internet startups. Twice a year, his company runs American Idol -style contests to select 20 to 30 budding companies for seed funding and attendance at a 10-week boot camp, culminating in a Demo Day packed with angel investors, VCs, and acquisition-hungry corporations like Google and Yahoo. How does Graham pick the most promising candidates? Easy. He looks for the hackers. \"We're pretty hackerly, so it's easy to recognize a kindred spirit,\" says Graham, who in 1995 cocreated Viaweb, the first Web-based application. \"Hackers understand a system well enough to be in charge of it and make it do their biddingand maybe make it do things that weren't intended.\" The best prospects, he says, are \"world hackers,\" people \"who understand not only how to mess with computers but how to mess with everything.\" Indeed, Graham says that today, every business is looking to hire or invest in firms run by hackers. \"We tell founders presenting at Demo Day, 'If you dress up too much, you will read to the investors as a stupid person.' They're coming to see the next Larry and Sergey, not some junior MBA type.\" Stallman would recoil in horror at Graham's equating hacking with entrepreneurial effectiveness. But Graham has found that hacking's values aren't threatened by businessthey have conquered business. Seat-of-the-pants problem-solving. Decentralized decisionmaking. Emphasizing quality of work over quality of wardrobe. These are all hacker ideals, and they have all infiltrated the working world. Facebook didn't start with some grand theory but with a project hacked together in a couple of weeks, Mark Zuckerberg says. Our whole culture is, we want to build something quickly. A new generation of hackers has emerged, techies who see business not as an enemy but as the means for their ideas and innovations to find the broadest audience possible. Take Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has lured 400 million users to share their personal lives online. At 25, he has proven to be a master of the art of business developmentunabashedly opening his site to advertisers and marketers. Yet he clearly thinks of himself as a hacker: Last year he told the audience at an event for would-be Internet entrepreneurs, \"We've got this whole ethos that we want to build a hacker culture.\" To find out what he meant by that, I visit him at Facebook headquarters, a large building on California Avenue in Palo Altothe same street where in 1983 I rented a room to use as a base while researching Hackers . Surprisingly, Zuckerberg, best known for wearing North Face fleece, is sporting a tie. He explains that he is nearing the end of a year in which he promised his team that he would show up for work in neckwear every day. It turned out to be a good year for Facebookdespite the recession, the site more than doubled its user base and finally turned a profit. \"Maybe it's a charm,\" he says of the tie. \"But I think it mostly just chokes me.\" Zuckerberg's adopted style may not come from the golden age of hacking, but his work ethic does. \"We didn't start with some grand theory but with a project hacked together in a couple of weeks,\" Zuckerberg says. \"Our whole culture is, we want to build something quickly.\" Every six to eight weeks, Facebook conducts \"hackathons,\" where people have one night to dream up and complete a project. \"The idea is that you can build something really good in a night,\" Zuckerberg says. \"And that's part of the personality of Facebook now. We have a big belief in moving fast, pushing boundaries, saying that it's OK to break things. It's definitely very core to my personality.\" In the ongoing competition for talent, Zuckerberg believes that the company with the best hackers wins. \"One good hacker can be as good as 10 or 20 engineers, and we try to embrace that. We want to be the place where the best hackers want to work, because our culture is set up so they can build stuff quickly and do crazy stuff and be recognized for standout brilliance.\" Unlike the original hackers, Zuckerberg's generation didn't have to start from scratch to get control of their machines. \"I never wanted to take apart my computer,\" he says. As a budding hacker in the late '90s, Zuckerberg tinkered with the higher-level languages, allowing him to concentrate on systems rather than machines. For instance, when he played with his beloved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Zuckerberg wouldn't act out wars with them, like most other kids. He would build societies and pretend the Turtles were interacting with one another. \"I was just interested in how systems work,\" he says. Similarly, when he began playing with computers, he didn't hack motherboards or telephones but entire communitiesmanipulating system bugs to kick his friends off AOL Instant Messenger, for instance. Like Gates, Zuckerberg is often accused of turning his back on hacker ideals, because he refuses to allow other sites to access the information that Facebook users contribute. But Zuckerberg says that the truth is just the opposite; his company piggybacksand buildson the free flow of information. \"I never wanted to have information that other people didn't have,\" he says. \"I just thought it should all be more available. From everything I read, that's a very core part of hacker culture. Like 'information wants to be free' and all that.\" A previous generation of hackersand Iworried that the world of commerce would choke innovation and stymie a burgeoning cultural movement. But hackerism has survived and thrived, a testament to its flexibility. According to computer-book publisher Tim O'Reilly who fosters hackerism through his Foo Camp unconferenceshacking culture will always find new outlets. Big business may stumble upon and commodify their breakthroughs, but hackers will simply move on to unexplored frontiers. \"It's like that line in Last Tango in Paris,\" O'Reilly says, \"where Marlon Brando says, 'It's over, and then it begins again.'\" The current frontier for hackers, O'Reilly says, is not the purely mathematical realm of 1s and 0s but actual stufftaking the same tear-it-down-and-build-it-anew attitude that programmers once took to compilers and applying it to body parts and wind-energy-harnessing kites. (O'Reilly Media publishes Make magazine and runs the Maker Faire festivals, celebrations of the DIY spirit.) But even this area, he says, has begun the shift toward entrepreneurship. The pure hackersthe ones who do things for the sheer pleasure of it and are turned off by investors and spreadsheetsare looking elsewhere. O'Reilly says most of the action is in DIY biologymanipulating genetic code the way a previous generation of hackers manipulated computer code. \"It's still in the fun stage,\" he says. Just ask Bill Gates. If he were a teenager today, he says, he'd be hacking biology. \"Creating artificial life with DNA synthesis. That's sort of the equivalent of machine-language programming,\" says Gates, whose work for the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation has led him to develop his own expertise in disease and immunology. \"If you want to change the world in some big way, that's where you should startbiological molecules.\" Which is why the hacker spirit will endure, he says, even in an era when computers are so ubiquitous and easy to control. \"There are more opportunities now,\" he says. \"But they're different opportunities. They need the same type of crazy fanaticism of youthful genius and naèFvetè9 that drove the PC industryand can have the same impact on the human condition.\" In other words, hackers will be the heroes of the next revolution, too.",

        "title": "A Top NASA Official Is Among Thousands of Staff Leaving the Agency",
        "content": "You can add another name to the thousands of employees leaving NASA as the Trump administration primes the space agency for a 25 percent budget cut. On Monday, NASA announced that Makenzie Lystrup will leave her post as director of the Goddard Space Flight Center on Friday, August 1. Lystrup has held the top job at Goddard since April 2023, overseeing a staff of more than 8,000 civil servants and contractor employees and a budget last year of about 4.7 billion. These figures make Goddard the largest of NASAs 10 field centers primarily devoted to scientific research and development of robotic space missions, with a budget and workforce comparable to NASAs human spaceflight centers in Texas, Florida, and Alabama. Officials at Goddard manage the James Webb and Hubble telescopes in space, and Goddard engineers are assembling the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, another flagship observatory scheduled for launch late next year. Were grateful to Makenzie for her leadership at NASA Goddard for more than two years, including her work to inspire a Golden Age of explorers, scientists, and engineers, Vanessa Wyche, NASAs acting associate administrator, said in a statement. Cynthia Simmons, Goddards deputy director, will take over as acting chief at the space center. Simmons started work at Goddard as a contract engineer 25 years ago. Lystrup came to NASA from Ball Aerospace, now part of BAE Systems, where she managed the companys work on civilian space projects for NASA and other federal agencies. Before joining Ball Aerospace, Lystrup earned a doctorate in astrophysics from University College London and conducted research as a planetary astronomer. The announcement of Lystrups departure from Goddard came hours after the release of an open letter to NASAs interim administrator , transportation secretary Sean Duffy , signed by hundreds of current and former agency employees. The letter, titled the The Voyager Declaration, identifies what the signatories call recent policies that have or threaten to waste public resources, compromise human safety, weaken national security, and undermine the core NASA mission. Major programmatic shifts at NASA must be implemented strategically so that risks are managed carefully, the letter reads. Instead, the last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASAs workforce. We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety, scientific advancement, and efficient use of public resources. The letter is modeled on similar documents of dissent penned by employees protesting cuts and policy changes at the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency. We urge you not to implement the harmful cuts proposed by this administration, as they are not in the best interest of NASA, the letter reads. We wish to preserve NASAs vital mission as authorized and appropriated by Congress. The signatories who chose to identify themselves dont include any current senior-level NASA officials, and theres nothing to suggest any link between the letter and Lystrups departure from Goddard. But its important to note that Goddard Space Flight Center, located in Greenbelt, Maryland, just outside of Washington, DC, would suffer outsize impacts from the Trump administrations proposed budget cuts. The White Houses budget request for fiscal year 2026 asks Congress for 18.8 billion to fund NASA, about 25 percent below this years budget. Funding for NASAs science directorate would be cut from 7.3 billion to 3.9 billion, a reduction that would force the cancellation of dozens of NASA missions currently in space or undergoing development. Appropriations committees in both houses of Congress advanced spending bills earlier this month that would restore NASAs funding close to this years budget of nearly 25 billion. The budget bills must still be voted on by the entire House and Senate before going to the White House for President Trumps signature. Makenzie Lystrup was sworn in as a federal employee using Carl Sagans Pale Blue Dot at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC. Courtesy of Keegan BarberNASA However, lawmakers are concerned the Trump administration might attempt to circumvent any congressional budget and move forward with more lasting cuts to NASA and other federal agencies through a process known as impoundment. This would likely trigger a court fight over the executive branchs authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress. The administration is proceeding with offers to federal civil servants of early retirement, buyouts, and deferred resignation. NASAs chief of staff, a Trump political appointee named Brian Hughes, said in a town hall meeting last month that the agency is operating under the assumption that the White Houses budget will become reality. So, the story is far from over. Goddards work is intertwined with NASAs science budget. Nearly 60 percent of Goddards funding comes from NASAs astrophysics, Earth science, heliophysics, and planetary science accountsall nested within the agencys science mission directorate. Several NASA facilities operate under Goddard management, including Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, Katherine Johnson Independent Verification  Validation Facility in West Virginia, White Sands Complex in New Mexico, and the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility in Texas. Another NASA facility girding for cutbacks is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a federally funded research center managed by Caltech in Pasadena, California. JPL has been the architect of most of NASAs robotic missions exploring the Solar System, such as the Voyager probes, a series of increasingly sophisticated Mars rovers, and most recently, the Europa Clipper mission that left Earth last year on the way to study the enigmatic icy moon of Jupiter. JPLs center director, Laurie Leshin, stepped down June 1 after ordering layoffs of more than 10 percent of the labs workforce last year, largely due to budget uncertainty over the future of NASAs Mars Sample Return program. The Trump administrations budget proposal calls for canceling the robotic Mars Sample Return program in favor of eventually bringing home rock specimens from the red planet on future human expeditions.

        "title": "Larry Ellison Is a ‘Shadow President’ in Donald Trump’s America",
        "content": "In Trumpworld, Larry Ellison gets more credit than anyone else for operating in the shadows. Over a drink earlier in Donald Trumps second term, one of the presidents advisers described the Oracle cofounder, chairman, and chief technology officer to me as a literal shadow president of the United States, if not necessarily the shadow president. In the months since, Ellison, whos been trading the title of richest man alive with Elon Musk lately, has begun to live up to the moniker. Musk is almost starting over from scratch, working his way back into Trumps good graces by seeming to pretend that whole ugly breakup and half-baked ploy to form a third party never happened. Rupert Murdoch is 94 years old and ceding more control of his media empire to his son Lachlan. Peter Thiel is running around interrogating the topic of the biblical antichrist . As nice as it is to be a billionaire, its even better to be one flying below most peoples radar in Trumps Washington. He does a brilliant job of being, lets call it the anti-Elon, a Trumpworld source in the AI industry tells me, referring to Ellison. Hes not kind of feared directly, but people in the know in Washington know he has some tremendous pull. With his family dynasty growing, Ellison, who at 81 is aging just as fast as anyone, could become as powerful as some combinations of those menif hes not already there. And yet even many of my Trumpworld sources dont know much about him, in part because, as some concede, he benefits from the fundamental lack of sexiness of his business of cloud applications and databases and servers. Given the unprecedented power and influence Ellison and his family are amassing, their lack of visibility may be about to change, no matter how much my sources in Trumpworld privately say they want more stealth from their tech billionaires in the post-Elon landscape. In an age where human attention is perhaps the worlds most valuable commodity, the Ellisons could be in charge of almost everything a modern-day pseudo robber baron could want by the end of this year or soon after. I spoke with sources who have dealt with Ellisonas well as others who know his son, Davidto get a sense of how he operates. And he operates a lot lately; the Trump administration has essentially sent a fair amount of business his way after Ellison established himself as a reliable, if sparing, GOP donor and fundraiser over the 2020 and 2024 cycles. Theres his pending dominance over vertical video with a key role in the proposed new ownership consortium for the US version of TikTok, for which Oracles servers already provide hosting. Theres airwave domination, with a news and entertainment behemoth under his sons control following the merger of Davids Skydance and Paramountwhich might possibly include the keys to not only CBS but also CNN, if Skydance actually puts in a bid and succeeds in a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery . The empire spans from the sweaty floor of the octagon after acquiring US broadcast rights to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (also under Paramount) all the way to the clay soil of Abilene, Texas, home of OpenAIs Stargate data center project led by Oracle and Softbank. Oracle is also linked to a 100 billion deal with Nvidia and OpenAI announced Monday. The Ellison family is cornering the market on attention and data the way the Vanderbilts did railroads and the Rockefellers did oil. Despite all of that, many of the presidents advisers and senior aides know little to nothing about the man atop it all. Ive never really heard anyone talk about him, tbh, one of Trumps advisers tells me in a text message. Not someone who really comes up all that much. Larry Ellison didnt used to be one of the boring Silicon Valley billionaires. Ellison has long demonstrated a penchant for flash and a longing for the spotlightbuying 98 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, attempting to acquire fighter jets from other countries, flying on unique private jets , sponsoring a yacht racing team, funding an international sailing competition, and earning a reputation decades ago as a womanizer even if its been diminished in Trump 2.0. The 1997 biography The Difference Between God and Larry Ellison wastes no time answering the titular question posed by author Mike Wilson, who got extensive interview time with the future centibillionaire: God doesnt think hes Larry Ellison. He may not be seen as God inside the White House, but at the very least, my Trumpworld sources tell me, Ellison isnt like most politically ambitious billionaires, even beyond his more staid business interests. For insiders, one of the most intriguing things is that he scouts his own political talent. Theres not a Larry political orbit like the one Elon has set up, one Republican in Trumpworld familiar with Ellisons political activities tells me. Normally, veterans of national campaigns and Capitol Hill can earn a lot of money by giving the ultra-wealthy the lay of the land, doing almost all of the legwork shy of signing the check. Larry, this person says, is very involved in calling those shots. A source who knows the Ellisons told me Larry began to drift away from the Democrats and toward the Republicans over the course of Barack Obamas terms in office. He was a big fan of Democratic politics, big fan of Bill Clinton, the source who knows the Ellison family says. He did a lot of fundraisers, is close to a lot of liberal politicians. And then Obama fucked up. (Ellison gave 3 million to a proMitt Romney super PAC in the 2012 cycle. He gave modestly to to the Democratic National Committee when Clinton was president , and while he hedged his bets with donations to Republicans, he was also once quoted as saying, We should have amended the Constitution to elect Bill Clinton to a third term.\") A staunch supporter of Israel and its military, Ellison perceived Obama to be hostile to the nation, according to the source who knows the family, as the presidents relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu deteriorated. (According to Haaretz, Ellison once offered Netanyahu a board seat at Oracle. Ellison denied the report. A representative for the former president declined to comment.) Early in his conservative arc, Ellison donated to a PAC supporting Marco Rubios 2016 presidential campaign and struck those who knew him at the time as a burgeoning moderate Republican. Maybe 10 years ago, he was like, I want Marco Rubio to be president, the same source says. Many players first started hearing of Ellison in the lead-up to the 2024 Republican presidential primary. At that point, after years of donating to both parties, Ellison was seen internally as doing Trump a small favor by pledging his financial support to senator Tim Scott, a Republican of South Carolina. My sources considered Scott to be a solid VP contender, if a slight long shot. He was seen as harmless at worst, and at best a potential insurance policy in the event of a prolonged primary campaigna potential spoiler candidate capable of pulling support from rivals, particularly fellow South Carolinian Nikki Haley. His involvement with GOP politicians like Tim Scott was the appetizer, a second Republican familiar with Ellisons political activities tells me, and Trump is the main course. Ellison, whos almost two years older than Trump, has been setting the groundwork for the successor to his family empire. The weight of his legacy falls on the shoulders of his 42-year-old son, David. Once an aspiring actor, David played a key role alongside James Franco in the 2006 WWI drama Flyboys which he also partially financed. When his onscreen career didnt take off, he figured he would be better not just behind the camera but up in the C-suite. Davids known political donations have been entirely to Democrats . But he is not known for having the same tactical nous as Larry. This is the exhausting part of it, a campaign staffer with knowledge of donor outreach involving the Ellison family tells me, describing David as someone who carried himself with the confidence of a business tycoon despite, at the point they interacted, only having been born to one. Ive dealt with a lot of people through my career who are nepo babies. Some of them feel like theyre moguls in their own right. This sourcewho, like others, requested anonymity to speak candidly about the political influence of the Ellison familysaid the nepo babies of the ultra wealthy tend to fall into two camps: There are those with pet policy issues and a desire to shape their legacy through some notion of making a difference, and there are those who want to accumulate power and influence for their own sake. He was always part of that latter group. Representatives for Larry and David Ellison did not return requests for comment. While my Trumpworld and Republican sources who have dealt with Larry Ellisons political activities say they take him to be more or less a true believer on most of their key issues at this pointmost notably seen in his support for the Israeli military, a focus on improving blue cities, and his financial interests in the AI industryfar less is known about his heir apparent. With a still vaguely described domestic iteration of TikTok and scores of TV channels from news to entertainment coming into the familys portfolio, it remains to be seen whether David Ellison will become a Murdoch-type figure, setting the agenda for the modern GOP and in control of properties occupying the top spot in the conservative media ecosystem in the way Fox News did for the past three decades. But with the widely rumored acquisition of the right-leaning media startup Free Press and reported interest in tapping cofounder Bari Weiss to run CBS Newsand even, potentially down the line, a merger with CNNhes already begun making Murdoch-type moves. (Weiss did not respond to a request for comment.) David always felt like, oh lets play both sides, the campaign staffer who dealt with him as a donor says. It was always a little bit like pulling teeth  to get him to engage, but he did and he did so willingly. It wasnt sketchy in any way, it was very much aboveboard, they continue. It felt less like trying to be a good citizen and more like, Whats going to benefit me? As for Larry, the way he has managed to cool his bad-boy image from the 1990s and find a way to be at the center of power in Trump 2.0 has certainly benefited him and put the family legacy on the strongest possible footing. Larry has found himself in this elder statesman role where, without saying anything, he can have a real impact, the source who knows the Ellisons tells me. And it looks like the strategy is working.",

It expects to notify the majority of affected employees by the end of March. As part of the announcement, iRobot chair and CEO Colin Angle, who co-founded the company in 1990, is stepping down from both roles. iRobots current executive vice president and chief legal officer, Glen Weinstein, will serve as interim CEO, and Andrew Miller, formerly lead independent director of the board, will become chair. As part of the restructuring, iRobot is pausing its work on devices outside of its core floor-cleaning product lineup like air purifiers and lawn mowers, and closing offices and facilities in smaller, underperforming geographies. The collapse of the deal means Amazon will pay a 94 million termination fee to iRobot, which will largely be used to help pay off a 200 million loan it took out last year. As part of todays announcement, iRobot published its preliminary fourth quarter results for 2023 and said it expects to report a GAAP operating loss of between 265 and 285 million. The announcement comes after the 1.4 billion acquisition ran into difficulties with EU regulators. Last November, the European Commission said it believed the deal had the potential to restrict competition in the robot vacuum cleaner market. Many of iRobots competitors also sell their devices on Amazons online store, and regulators were concerned that Amazon could delist or reduce the visibility of rival robot vacuum cleaners, restricting competition and leading to higher prices, lower quality, and less innovation for consumers. Amazon had until January 10th to try to convince the European Commission to let the deal go through, but Politico reported that the deadline passed without Amazon offering any concessions. The companies first announced the deal in August 2022 and received the go-ahead from the UKs competition regulator in June 2023. Undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs In a statement, Amazon SVP and general counsel David Zapolsky said he was disappointed that the deal couldnt proceed. This outcome will deny consumers faster innovation and more competitive prices, which were confident would have made their lives easier and more enjoyable, Zapolsky said. Mergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that arent subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics. Undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles discourage entrepreneurs, who should be able to see acquisition as one path to success, and that hurts both consumers and competition. The deal is one of several major tech acquisitions to have fallen apart in recent years as global regulators ramp up scrutiny. Adobe walked away from its 20 billion deal to buy Figma late last year in the face of pressure from UK and EU regulators, Nvidia formally abandoned its 40 billion Arm deal , citing significant regulatory challenges in early 2022, and even Meta was unable to buy Giphy . Microsoft was able to push its deal to buy Activision Blizzard through , but only after first granting concessions to the UK and EU authorities . In the past, Amazon has been able to make smart home acquisitions with less difficulty. It acquired camera and doorbell company Blink in 2017 , home security company Ring in 2018 , and mesh router company Eero in 2019 . Since then, Amazon has maintained the individual brand names of the companies and has continued to sell competing devices via its online store. In the time since announcing its plans to buy iRobot, Amazons devices and services business has gained a new boss. When the deal was first announced, Dave Limp was still serving as Amazon hardwares top executive. But as of the end of October 2023, Limp had been replaced by Panos Panay , who moved into the role from Microsoft, while Limp has transitioned to CEO of Jeff Bezos aerospace company, Blue Origin.",

        "title": "DJI escapes US drone ban — but may get banned automatically unless Trump steps in",
        "content": "The US Senate has passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the annual defense spending bill, and it may have major consequences for the worlds largest drone company  though not necessarily the immediate ban that Chinas DJI feared. While it did not contain the full Countering CCP Drones Act provisions that would have quickly blocked imports of DJI products into the United States, it instead kicks off a one-year countdown until its products (and those of rival dronemaker Autel Robotics) are automatically banned. Related DJI sues the US Department of Defense for labeling it a Chinese Military Company DJI says US customs is blocking its drone imports If DJI cannot convince an appropriate national security agency to publicly declare that its products do not pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States, the act instructs the FCC to add DJIs gear to its covered list under the Secure and Trusted Communication Networks Act. Not only does that list keep that gear from running on US networks, it bars the FCC from authorizing their internal radios for use in the US, effectively blocking all imports. While none of that would keep US citizens from continuing to use their existing DJI gadgets, it wouldnt just ban new DJI drones from import into the United States. Every DJI product with a radio or camera, like the Verge favorite DJI Osmo Pocket 3 , would technically be banned. (The NDAA doesnt specify just drones, but rather communications and video surveillance equipment.) The text of the bill (PDF, see page 1084-1088) should theoretically prevent DJI from exploiting the loophole of whitelabeling its drones under other brand names or licensing its technology, too, as it seemed to be doing with the Anzu Robotics Raptor and Cogito Specta . The bill explicitly tells the FCC to add any subsidiary, affiliate, or partner and any entity to which the named entity has a technology sharing or licensing agreement to the covered list, too. The bill had already passed the House of Representatives and is headed to President Bidens desk, where its considered a must-sign: it would trigger a partial government shutdown if not signed, and it already passed both houses of Congress with strong bipartisan support. So itll really be up to the Trump administration as to whether it wants to rescue the Chinese drone company, in the year after he takes office. Trump may not need to lift a finger if hed prefer to see fewer DJI products in the country, so the balls in DJIs court. It wouldnt be surprising if DJI tries to get face time with Trump in the near future  like TikTok, which is more imminently facing a ban . Related TikTok CEO meets with Trump as the platform tries to avoid a ban US targets TP-Link with a potential ban on the Chinese routers Even without the NDAA, DJI was already facing increased US scrutiny, reporting that its products had begun to see surprise import restrictions (allegedly over the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act), and making a conscious decision to ship fewer of them into the United States as a result. In October, it sued the US Department of Defense for labeling it a Chinese Military Company. In a blog post , DJI calls it good news that the NDAA doesnt explicitly ban DJI products, but says the US government is singling out Chinese drones for scrutiny, and worries about the fact that the law doesnt specify a government agency to actually carry out the task of determining whether it poses a risk. This means that DJI would be prevented from launching new products in the US market through no fault of its own, but simply because no agency chose to take on the work of studying our products, the company writes. Its asking Congress to pick a technically focused agency to assure the assessment is evidence-based, and to give the company the opportunity to reply.",

        "title": "Google apologizes for ‘missing the mark’ after Gemini generated racially diverse Nazis",
        "content": "Google has apologized for what it describes as inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions with its Gemini AI tool, saying its attempts at creating a wide range of results missed the mark. The statement follows criticism that it depicted specific white figures (like the US Founding Fathers) or groups like Nazi-era German soldiers as people of color, possibly as an overcorrection to long-standing racial bias problems in AI. Were aware that Gemini is offering inaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions, says the Google statement, posted this afternoon on X . Were working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately. Geminis AI image generation does generate a wide range of people. And thats generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But its missing the mark here. My Gemini results for generate a picture of an American woman, one of the prompts that set off the debate of the past few days. Google began offering image generation through its Gemini (formerly Bard) AI platform earlier this month, matching the offerings of competitors like OpenAI. Over the past few days, however, social media posts have questioned whether it fails to produce historically accurate results in an attempt at racial and gender diversity. As the Daily Dot chronicles , the controversy has been promoted largely  though not exclusively  by right-wing figures attacking a tech company thats perceived as liberal. Earlier this week, a former Google employee posted on X that its embarrassingly hard to get Google Gemini to acknowledge that white people exist, showing a series of queries like generate a picture of a Swedish woman or generate a picture of an American woman. The results appeared to overwhelmingly or exclusively show AI-generated people of color. (Of course, all the places he listed do have women of color living in them, and none of the AI-generated women exist in any country.) The criticism was taken up by right-wing accounts that requested images of historical groups or figures like the Founding Fathers and purportedly got overwhelmingly non-white AI-generated people as results. Some of these accounts positioned Googles results as part of a conspiracy to avoid depicting white people, and at least one used a coded antisemitic reference to place the blame. Gemini wouldnt produce an image of a 1943 soldier on desktop for me, but it offered this set of illustrations to a colleague. Google didnt reference specific images that it felt were errors; in a statement to The Verge , it reiterated the contents of its post on X. But its plausible that Gemini has made an overall attempt to boost diversity because of a chronic lack of it in generative AI. Image generators are trained on large corpuses of pictures and written captions to produce the best fit for a given prompt, which means theyre often prone to amplifying stereotypes. A Washington Post investigation last year found that prompts like a productive person resulted in pictures of entirely white and almost entirely male figures, while a prompt for a person at social services uniformly produced what looked like people of color. Its a continuation of trends that have appeared in search engines and other software systems. Some of the accounts that criticized Google defended its core goals. Its a good thing to portray diversity  in certain cases , noted one person who posted the image of racially diverse 1940s German soldiers. The stupid move here is Gemini isnt doing it in a nuanced way. And while entirely white-dominated results for something like a 1943 German soldier would make historical sense, thats much less true for prompts like an American woman, where the question is how to represent a diverse real-life group in a small batch of made-up portraits. For now, Gemini appears to be simply refusing some image generation tasks. It wouldnt generate an image of Vikings for one Verge reporter, although I was able to get a response. On desktop, it resolutely refused to give me images of German soldiers or officials from Germanys Nazi period or to offer an image of an American president from the 1800s. Geminis results for the prompt generate a picture of a US senator from the 1800s. Screenshot by Adi Robertson But some historical requests still do end up factually misrepresenting the past. A colleague was able to get the mobile app to deliver a version of the German soldier prompt  which exhibited the same issues described on X. And while a query for pictures of the Founding Fathers returned group shots of almost exclusively white men who vaguely resembled real figures like Thomas Jefferson, a request for a US senator from the 1800s returned a list of results Gemini promoted as diverse, including what appeared to be Black and Native American women. (The first female senator , a white woman, served in 1922.) Its a response that ends up erasing a real history of race and gender discrimination  inaccuracy, as Google puts it, is about right.

Trump Inauguration, Awash in Cash, Runs Out of Perks for Big Donors , The New York Times reported, somewhat inaccurately. Sure, the Trump people ran out of VIP tickets, but thats not what the donors were buying. This is pure, obvious corruption  the kind that used to trigger shame, back when we were a populace that could still experience that emotion. Our tech overlords all have problems, and they want to buy the solutions. I guess it was easier than making products people actually like. First Buddy  Elon Musk spent at least a quarter of a billion dollars electing Donald Trump. Corporations and wealthy donors have sent half a billion more since he was elected. Amazon, Google, Uber, Microsoft, and Meta donated 1 million each to Trumps inauguration, as did Apples Tim Cook and OpenAIs Sam Altman. (Joe Bidens inauguration hardly received this kind of largesse.) In the first term, everybody was fighting me, Trump said in December . In this term, everybody wants to be my friend.

Perhaps nobody has spent more to buy a break from public scrutiny than the crypto industry Nearly every major tech company has at least one lawsuit pending. Apple has an antitrust suit pending . Google just lost one . Theres also a Federal Trade Commission suit that could peel Instagram and WhatsApp off Meta . Trump cares little about the actual purpose of antitrust enforcement: making companies compete for customers with good products. All the pending litigation is just leverage for Trump to punish anyone who doesnt fall in line. And Silicon Valley is more disinterested in consumers than ever. Get out of jail free is a pretty famous card in the game of Monopoly, after all. Image: Mark Harris for The Verge Perhaps nobody has spent more to buy a break from public scrutiny than the crypto industry. The crypto guys are just blowing it out, an anonymous Trump advisor told Axios . It used to be 1 million was a big number. Now were looking at some folks giving like 10 million or 20 million. They want a friendly Securities and Exchange Commission. Venture capitalist and PayPal Mafioso David Sacks has already been named as a crypto czar. And theres a pending executive order to name crypto a national imperative or priority  strategic wording intended to guide government agencies to work with the industry, according to Bloomberg. We may even be about to witness our very first presidential meme coin pump-and-dump . Crypto is good for little besides crime and gambling, and less regulation means more chances for people to get scammed by the next FTX. (Speaking of gambling, Robinhood donated 2 million to the Trump inaugural fund.) On top of that, the executive order means a higher likelihood of crypto getting shoveled into new government projects  whether its useful or not. Crypto capture could even extend to soft-pedaling enforcement of the assorted criminal industries that rely on it. Then theres the taxes, of course. The billionaires dont want to pay them, and Trump is amenable to that . Scott Bessent, nominated for Treasury Secretary , said the most important economic issue of the day was making sure tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy stayed in place. Bessent is accused of being a tax dodge himself . Mass privatization could make things even more profitable for the tech industry But thats all small potatoes. The real money is in the military.

As usual, hes given the game away by bragging about it on a podcast. Silicon Valley investors generally have been bullish on defense tech like industry poster children Anduril and Palantir. (a16z is a major Anduril backer, and both companies are founded and owned by some of the Valleys earliest MAGA faithful.)

Dataresearch stuff is an obvious bonanza, but Musks criticisms of the F-35 program suggest much broader targeting. Greater military investment in drones, for instance, would likely benefit Anduril. Musk already makes rockets, which means its a short leap for SpaceX to make missiles. And should the Trump administration carry out its mass deportation threats , there will doubtless be demand for more databases, mass tracking, and detention centers. But this isnt a friendly clown car all these men have packed themselves into. Their interests simply do not align. Zuckerberg is the biggest beneficiary of a TikTok ban and has practically begged Trump to punish Apple for him . Trump may have changed his mind on banning TikTok, though, perhaps because a major conservative donor owns a 15 percent stake. Apple is dependent on Chinese manufacturing and needs exemptions from the Trump administrations promised tariffs . Andreessen has asked for the breakup of Google , which is now appealing its monopoly judgment. Everyone wants to steal contracts from Microsoft. Jeff Bezos and Musk are rivals for space contacts. If we know anything from Trumps first term, its that he loves people jockeying for his favor. Sure, that means mess, but it also means funny bedfellows. For instance, everyone hates the EUs regulatory regime. Its easy to imagine Zuckerberg, Musk, and Cook teaming up to get Trump to defang the EUs Digital Services Act  and then immediately turning on each other. Being in Trumps good graces is a zero sum game, and the prize is that the clown car is eventually going to go right over a cliff. Selective legal enforcement puts every company under a sword of Damocles Keeping Trump happy could be expensive, but cheaper than legal battles. Selective legal enforcement puts every company under a sword of Damocles  make the wrong move and you can be cut to shreds by lackeys in Congress or the FCC . Just look at TikToks fawning appeals to Dear Leader . The Supreme Court has upheld the TikTok ban, but if Trump only punishes the people he doesnt like, nothing happens to TikTok . (Crucially, the laws still on the books to keep other Chinese competitors in line.) Did I mention TikToks CEO Shou Chew got a front-row invite to Trumps inauguration from the man himself? I suppose I have to explain why this makes the US a shittier place to live, given the savvy cynicism Ive seen about how its all rotten here already. Tech companies, padding their bottom lines, have made their experiences worse, a phenomenon so widespread and well-recognized that now theres slang for it . Whether the scandals are scams, child predation, worker exploitation, or violations of user privacy  pick your poison  Trump has offered tech a way to buy itself out of consequences. That makes life tangibly worse for everyone who isnt a billionaire. There are those who will say that this is good  that the corruption is happening in the open instead of the shadows. But public, open corruption allows even more rottenness to fester in secret. Consider all the strongman governments; besides their advances in bribery, what did they innovate? Silicon Valleys leaders fashion themselves as titans of industry, but what theyre really building is a golden age of grift.",

        "content": "If you were thinking of booking an Airbnb to host a rowdy New Years Eve shindig, the company is already one step ahead of you. Airbnb says its rolling out anti-party technology worldwide to help prevent unauthorized and disruptive get togethers over the holiday. Airbnb describes its anti-party technology as machine learning tools to identify and block risky bookings. The tech will be rolled out globally, but Airbnb specifically called out the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Puerto Rico, Spain, and New Zealand. It assesses things like trip length, when the reservation is being made, and how far the booking is from your current location. If a booking is deemed a high risk, guests will either be blocked or redirected to different accommodations. For folks hoping to book an entire home for a short holiday getaway, reservations of one to three nights will also be blocked. Guests booking entire homes will also have to agree to a mandatory anti-party attestation. Airbnb says it blocked 74,000 such bookings last New Years Eve, with roughly 33,000 of those coming from the US. The companys stance against disruptive parties isnt new. It started banning party houses in 2019 and added tighter restrictions in 2020 during the covid-19 pandemic as a public health measure. Airbnb then decided to permanently ban rowdy parties worldwide in 2022. The decision came after several shootings occurred at parties hosted at Airbnbs, including an incident where two teenagers were killed and eight people wounded at a Pittsburgh rental.",

Zuckerberg is the biggest beneficiary of a TikTok ban and has practically begged Trump to punish Apple for him . Trump may have changed his mind on banning TikTok, though, perhaps because a major conservative donor owns a 15 percent stake. Apple is dependent on Chinese manufacturing and needs exemptions from the Trump administrations promised tariffs . Andreessen has asked for the breakup of Google , which is now appealing its monopoly judgment. Everyone wants to steal contracts from Microsoft. Jeff Bezos and Musk are rivals for space contacts. If we know anything from Trumps first term, its that he loves people jockeying for his favor. Sure, that means mess, but it also means funny bedfellows. For instance, everyone hates the EUs regulatory regime. Its easy to imagine Zuckerberg, Musk, and Cook teaming up to get Trump to defang the EUs Digital Services Act  and then immediately turning on each other. Being in Trumps good graces is a zero sum game, and the prize is that the clown car is eventually going to go right over a cliff. Selective legal enforcement puts every company under a sword of Damocles Keeping Trump happy could be expensive, but cheaper than legal battles. Selective legal enforcement puts every company under a sword of Damocles  make the wrong move and you can be cut to shreds by lackeys in Congress or the FCC . Just look at TikToks fawning appeals to Dear Leader . The Supreme Court has upheld the TikTok ban, but if Trump only punishes the people he doesnt like, nothing happens to TikTok . (Crucially, the laws still on the books to keep other Chinese competitors in line.) Did I mention TikToks CEO Shou Chew got a front-row invite to Trumps inauguration from the man himself? I suppose I have to explain why this makes the US a shittier place to live, given the savvy cynicism Ive seen about how its all rotten here already. Tech companies, padding their bottom lines, have made their experiences worse, a phenomenon so widespread and well-recognized that now theres slang for it . Whether the scandals are scams, child predation, worker exploitation, or violations of user privacy  pick your poison  Trump has offered tech a way to buy itself out of consequences. That makes life tangibly worse for everyone who isnt a billionaire. There are those who will say that this is good  that the corruption is happening in the open instead of the shadows. But public, open corruption allows even more rottenness to fester in secret. Consider all the strongman governments; besides their advances in bribery, what did they innovate? Silicon Valleys leaders fashion themselves as titans of industry, but what theyre really building is a golden age of grift.",

        "title": "A single point of failure triggered the Amazon outage affecting millions",
        "content": "The outage that hit Amazon Web Services and took out vital services worldwide was the result of a single failure that cascaded from system to system within Amazons sprawling network, according to a post-mortem from company engineers. The series of failures lasted for 15 hours and 32 minutes, Amazon said . Network intelligence company Ookla said its DownDetector service received more than 17 million reports of disrupted services offered by 3,500 organizations. The three biggest countries where reports originated were the US, the UK, and Germany. Snapchat, AWS, and Roblox were the most reported services affected. Ookla said the event was among the largest internet outages on record for Downdetector. Amazon said the root cause of the outage was a software bug in software running the DynamoDB DNS management system. The system monitors the stability of load balancers by, among other things, periodically creating new DNS configurations for endpoints within the AWS network. A race condition is an error that makes a process dependent on the timing or sequence events that are variable and outside the developers control. The result can be unexpected behavior and potentially harmful failures. In this case, the race condition resided in the DNS Enactor, a DynamoDB component that constantly updates domain lookup tables in individual AWS endpoints to optimize load balancing as conditions change. As the enactor operated, it experienced unusually high delays needing to retry its update on several of the DNS endpoints. While the enactor was playing catch-up, a second DynamoDB component, the DNS Planner, continued to generate new plans. Then, a separate DNS Enactor began to implement them. The timing of these two enactors triggered the race condition, which ended up taking out the entire DynamoDB. As Amazon engineers explained: When the second Enactor (applying the newest plan) completed its endpoint updates, it then invoked the plan clean-up process, which identifies plans that are significantly older than the one it just applied and deletes them. At the same time that this clean-up process was invoked, the first Enactor (which had been unusually delayed) applied its much older plan to the regional DDB endpoint, overwriting the newer plan. The check that was made at the start of the plan application process, which ensures that the plan is newer than the previously applied plan, was stale by this time due to the unusually high delays in Enactor processing. Therefore, this did not prevent the older plan from overwriting the newer plan. The second Enactors clean-up process then deleted this older plan because it was many generations older than the plan it had just applied. As this plan was deleted, all IP addresses for the regional endpoint were immediately removed. Additionally, because the active plan was deleted, the system was left in an inconsistent state that prevented subsequent plan updates from being applied by any DNS Enactors. This situation ultimately required manual operator intervention to correct. The failure caused systems that relied on the DynamoDB in Amazons US-East-1 regional endpoint to experience errors that prevented them from connecting. Both customer traffic and internal AWS services were affected. The damage resulting from the DynamoDB failure then put a strain on Amazons EC2 services located in the US-East-1 region. The strain persisted even after DynamoDB was restored, as EC2 in this region worked through a significant backlog of network state propagations needed to be processed. The engineers went on to say: While new EC2 instances could be launched successfully, they would not have the necessary network connectivity due to the delays in network state propagation. In turn, the delay in network state propagations spilled over to a network load balancer that AWS services rely on for stability. As a result, AWS customers experienced connection errors from the US-East-1 region. AWS network functions affected included the creating and modifying Redshift clusters, Lambda invocations, and Fargate task launches such as Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow, Outposts lifecycle operations, and the AWS Support Center. For the time being, Amazon has disabled the DynamoDB DNS Planner and the DNS Enactor automation worldwide while it works to fix the race condition and add protections to prevent the application of incorrect DNS plans. Engineers are also making changes to EC2 and its network load balancer. Ookla outlined a contributing factor not mentioned by Amazon: a concentration of customers who route their connectivity through the US-East-1 endpoint and an inability to route around the region. Ookla explained: The affected USEAST1 is AWSs oldest and most heavily used hub. Regional concentration means even global apps often anchor identity, state or metadata flows there. When a regional dependency fails as was the case in this event, impacts propagate worldwide because many global stacks route through Virginia at some point. Modern apps chain together managed services like storage, queues, and serverless functions. If DNS cannot reliably resolve a critical endpoint (for example, the DynamoDB API involved here), errors cascade through upstream APIs and cause visible failures in apps users do not associate with AWS. That is precisely what Downdetector recorded across Snapchat, Roblox, Signal, Ring, HMRC, and others. The event serves as a cautionary tale for all cloud services: More important than preventing race conditions and similar bugs is eliminating single points of failure in network design. The way forward, Ookla said, is not zero failure but contained failure, achieved through multi-region designs, dependency diversity, and disciplined incident readiness, with regulatory oversight that moves toward treating the cloud as systemic components of national and economic resilience.",

        "title": "Satellite shows what’s really happening at the East Wing of the White House",
        "content": "You need to go up way up to fully appreciate the changes underway at the White House this week. Demolition crews starting tearing down the East Wing of the presidential mansion Tuesday to clear room for the construction of a new 300 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a recent priority of President Donald Trump. The teardown drew criticism and surprise from Democratic lawmakers , former White House staffers , and members of the public. It was, after all, just three months ago that President Donald Trump defended his ballroom plan by saying it wouldnt affect the existing structure at the White House. It wont interfere with the current building, he said in July. Itll be near it but not touching itand pays total respect to the existing building, which Im the biggest fan of. So it shocked a lot of people when workers took a wrecking ball to the East Wing. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) told reporters Thursday that the optics are bad as the Trump administration demolishes part of the White House, especially during a government shutdown . People are saying, Oh, the governments being destroyed,' she said. Well, now it looks like the White House is physically being destroyed. The US Secret Service on Thursday closed access to the Ellipse , a public park overlooking the South Lawn of the White House. Journalists were capturing live images of the East Wing destruction from the Ellipse before the Secret Service ushered them out of the park, according to CNNs Jim Sciutto . Employees at the Treasury Building, just across the street from the East Wing, were instructed not to share photos of the demolition work, The Wall Street Journal reported . Some Trump supporters used their social media accounts to push back against the outcry, claiming only a small section of the East Wings facade would be torn down. An image taken from space revealed the reality Thursday. Without press access to see the demolition firsthand, it fell to a camera hundreds of miles above the White House to see what was really happening at the East Wing. Planet Labs released an image taken Thursday morning from one of its SkySat satellites showing the 123-year-old annex leveled. What became known as the East Wing was first constructed in 1902 and was then rebuilt in 1942 during the Franklin Roosevelt administration to create more office space and provide cover for a bunker during World War II. In modern presidencies, the East Wing was typically home to the first ladys staff. Planet Labs, based in San Francisco, operates a fleet of hundreds of small Earth-imaging satellites mapping the planet every day. The company sells its imagery to commercial customers and the US government, including intelligence agencies, which use the imagery to augment the surveillance capabilities of more exquisite government-owned spy satellites. Users often turn to satellite imagery from companies like Planet Labs to find out whats going on in war zones , countries ruled by authoritarian regimes , or in the aftermath of a natural disaster . Satellite constellations like Planet Labs scan for changes across the globe every day, making it virtually impossible to hide a large construction project. The SkySat satellite used for Thursdays examination of the White House flies at an altitude of approximately 295 miles (475 kilometers). It can capture imagery with a resolution of about 20 inches (50 centimeters) per pixel. Planet Labs owns 15 SkySats, each with three overlapping 5.5-megapixel imaging sensors fitted under a downward-facing 14-inch-diameter (35-centimeter) telescope, according to the company. It turns out some of Planet Labs cohorts among the governments cadre of defense and aerospace contractors are actually funding the construction of the new White House ballroom. Lockheed Martin, the Pentagons largest defense contractor, is on the list of donors released by the White House. At least two other companies with business relating to defense and aerospace were also on the list: Booz Allen Hamilton and Palantir Technologies. Palantir has invested in BlackSky , one of Planets competitors in the commercial remote sensing market. The Trump administration has said no public money will go toward the new ballroom, but officials havent said how much each donor is contributing. Many donors have business dealings with the federal government, raising ethical concerns that those paying for the ballroom might win favor in future contract decisions. Trump said he will also contribute an undisclosed sum for the ballroom. Regardless of whether the donors are buying influence, they are funding the most significant overhaul of the White House grounds since former President Harry Truman renovated the mansions interior and added a balcony to the South Portico. The Truman-era changes were approved by Congress, which established a commission to oversee the work. Theres been no such oversight from Congress this time. The new ballroom will be nearly twice the size of the most iconic element of the White House grounds: the two-century-old executive residence. Its going to turn the executive mansion into an annex to the party space, said Edward Lengel , who served as chief historian of the White House Historical Association during Trumps first term. I think all the founders would have been disgusted by this, he told CNN. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, shared a different point of view in an interview with Fox News earlier this week. I believe theres a lot of fake outrage right now because nearly every single president who has lived in this beautiful White House behind me has made modernizations and renovations of their own, Leavitt said. An official White House fact sheet published Tuesday used similar sensationalized language, accusing unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies of clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trumps visionary addition of a grand, privately-funded ballroom to the White House. Its true that every president has put their own mark on the White House, but all of the updates cost at least an order of magnitude less than Trumps ballroom. Most amounted to little more than redecorating, and none were as destructive as this weeks teardown. Former President Barack Obama repainted the lines of the White House tennis court and installed hoops to turn it into a basketball court. During the George W. Bush administration, the White House press briefing room got a significant makeover. Taxpayers and media companies shared the bill. Its hard to imagine that happening today. Former President Gerald Ford had an outdoor swimming pool built near the West Wing. Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy famously spearheaded the redesign of the White House Rose Garden and East Garden, which was later renamed in her honor. The grass in the Rose Garden was paved over with stone tiles earlier this year, and the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden was razed this week, the result of which was also visible from space. In July, Leavitt said the East Wing would be modernized. Like Trump, she did not mention plans for demolition, only saying: The necessary construction will take place. Thanks to satellites and commercial space, we now know what necessary construction really meant.",

        "title": "Bats eat the birds they pluck from the sky while on the wing",
        "content": "There are three species of bats that eat birds. We know that because we have found feathers and other avian remains in their feces. What we didnt know was how exactly they hunt birds, which are quite a bit heavier, faster, and stronger than the insects bats usually dine on. To find out, Elena Tena, a biologist at Doñana Biological Station in Seville, Spain, and her colleagues attached ultra-light sensors to Nyctalus Iasiopterus , the largest bats in Europe. What they found was jaw-droppingly brutal. Nyctalus Iasiopterus , otherwise known as greater noctule bats, have a wingspan of about 45 centimeters. They have reddish-brown or chestnut fur with a slightly paler underside, and usually weigh around 40 to 60 grams. Despite that minimal weight, they are the largest of the three bat species known to eat birds, so the key challenge in getting a glimpse into the way they hunt was finding sensors light enough to not impede the bats flight. Cameras, which are the usual go-to sensor, were out of the question. Bats hunt at night, so youd need night vision cameras, which together with batteries are too heavy for a bat to carry. Our sensors had to weigh below 10 percent of the weight of the batfour to six grams, Tena explained. Tena and her team explored several alternative approaches throughout the last decade, including watching the bats from the ground or using military-grade radars. But even then, catching the hunting bats red-handed remained impossible. A study from 2000 hypothesized that greater noctule bats most likely attack birds at their roosts, where theyre most vulnerable. When Tena recovered the sensors and downloaded the data, she learned the bats did no such thing. Instead, they engaged the birds at high altitudes, like World War II interceptors attacking formations of bombersthink Steven Spielbergs Masters of the Air drama. And it wasnt pretty. The Masters of the Air comparisons are justified in that the bats used similar tactics. But because theyre solitary hunters, they performed them individually, not in larger groups. Their attacks on birds, which the team later identified as European robins, began with the bats climbing very highup to 1.2 kilometers into the night sky over Spain, where the study took place. But even more surprising than the hunt itself was the way bats handled their prey after a successful attack. Tenas team found severed avian wings on the ground beneath the location of the aerial battles between birds and bats. That was another thing we learned, Tena said. Bats that managed to catch a bird did not landtheir altitude did not change. They were consuming those birds mid-air. Tena thinks the bats bite off the wings to reduce drag and the weight of the bird. Tena thinks passerine birds flying at high altitudes at night are a food source that very few predators have managed to tap into. Falcons, which can also hunt migrating birds in flight, usually do so during the day. Nocturnal avian predators like owls, on the other hand, typically do not fly that high and hunt closer to the ground. Greater noctule bats can likely feed on night-flying passerine birds without any formidable competition. Still, there are a few questions that remain unanswered. The first is how effective the bats are in targeting birds. We dont have enough data to say what is their success rate, Tena said. Most of the data her team collected focused on greater noctule bats doing something else they normally do: hunting insects. Attacks on birds were an exception rather than the norm for them. We confirmed two cases of such attacks in our data. One was successful, the other one was not, so based on what we have, you could say they are 50 percent effective. But thats hardly conclusive, and the truth is we dont know, Tena explained. Another unknown is the extent to which the bats diet relies on birds, which are likely harder to catch than insects. What we also want to investigate is anti-predator behavior in those birds. We know they cant hear ultra-frequency sounds bats use for echolocation so perhaps they rely on listening for wing beats, but we cant be sure, Tena said. For now, though, her team wants to focus on analyzing the data they already collected. We published the portion about birds because it was the most impressive, but we also have huge amounts of data on bats hunting insects, Tena explained. Greater noctule bats are considered an endangered species in Spain, and understating their habitats and foraging behaviors, Tena thinks, should help inform future conservation efforts. Still, at some point we want to tag the bats again, perhaps with even better sensors, Tena said. Theres a lot we are still missing for whats happening above our heads.",

Meanwhile, the person replacing him as director is a close friend of Vice President JD Vance and was installed in a process that experts describe as completely outside standard hiring practices. The series of eventsrevealed in an email to staff last week from the National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharyais only exacerbating the spiraling fears that science is being deeply corrupted by politics under the Trump administration. Richard Woychik, a molecular geneticist, is the outgoing director of the NIHs National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), which is located in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. He has been director since 2020 and was recently appointed to a second five-year term, according to Science magazine . Woychik was hired at the institute in 2010, when he joined as deputy director, and was appointed acting director in 2019. As the director of NIEHS, Woychik was also the director of the National Toxicology Program (NTP). This is an interagency program that has produced two highly controversial scientific reports during Woychiks time in NIEHSs upper leadership. One, initially released in 2016 , claimed that cellphone radiation causes cancer based on findings from rats, though only male rats. The final reports were published in 2018. Another controversial study, finalized this year , suggested that high levels of fluoride lower the IQ of children. Both the cellphone radiation and fluoride studies have been roundly criticized for flaws in their methodology and analysis, and the scientific community has largely dismissed them. However, the studies align withand bolsterthe conspiracy theories and misinformation spread by the MAHA movement, which is led by ardent anti-vaccine activist and current US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As health secretary, Kennedy has pledged to remove fluoride from municipal water, which, over decades, has proven safe and highly effective at preventing tooth decay in children. He has also, at various times, suggested 5G cell phone radiation causes cancer, a variety of other health conditions, changes to DNA, and is used as mass surveillance. Woychik will now be working to advance these and other MAHA agenda items. In Bhattacharyas email announcement, he said Woychik accepted a senior role within the NIH Office of the Director. Meanwhile, NIEHS and the NTP will now be headed by neuroepidemiologist Kyle Walsh, who considers JD Vance one of his closest friends . Both attended Ohio State University and Yale University around the same time. Vance officiated Walshs wedding and later lived with Walsh and his wife for a few months. Walsh later worked for Vance while he was a senator. Toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, who led NIEHS in the 2010s, told Science that Walshs hiring did not follow in any way the standard procedure that NIH uses to hire new institute directors, which normally involves a national search committee and interviews with multiple candidates. Birnbaum also told The News  Observer that Walsh doesnt appear to be a good fit for running an environmental health institute with a 914 million budget. His background, which is focused on brain aging and cancer, doesnt seem to point to an environmental health focus and doesnt include managerial experience. Jeremy Berg, former director of another NIH institute, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, told the outlet that he was shocked by the appointment, also noting the apparent lack of rigorous vetting. Health department spokesperson Emily Hilliard defended Walshs hiring, saying: NIH appointments will continue to reflect the agencys commitment to selecting leaders with strong scientific expertise who can help NIH continue to produce the best medical research in the world.",

        "title": "F1 in Mexico City: We have a new championship leader",
        "content": "Mexico City is one of the more unusual places that Formula 1 races, and its all thanks to altitude. The city sits at than 7,350 feet (2,240 m) above sea level, which makes the air noticeably thin compared to the average Grand Prix held at sea level. Like humans, F1 cars need air. Oxygen is necessary if you want any internal combustion to happen inside the turbocharged 1.6 L V6 engine. A good flow of air across the various radiators and heat exchangers in the car is vital if you want to make it to the end of the race. And the downforce-generating wings and underbody only generate downforce by creating differences in air pressure above and below the car. At over a mile above sea level, theres about 20 percent less air, and therefore less power created by combustion, less efficient cooling of the cars, and less downforce able to be generated. Thats why, despite a very long straight that sees F1 cars reach some of their highest speeds all yearwell over 210 mph (337 kmh)the cars feature Monaco-spec wings that generate as much downforce as possible. Mexico City-spec adds lots of new vents and louvres to the cars bodywork as well as the high downforce elements, and even so, engine problems are a little more common here than elsewhere due to thermal management. The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit stands out in another way, too: Its the only one with a baseball stadium dropped in the middle of it. The stadium is no longer used for the bat-and-ball sport, but it fills up for F1 with up to 40,000 fans, even if they dont have the most exciting array of corners to watch. Its been 13 years since the last time F1 saw a change in the championship lead so late in the season, but thats just what happened this weekend. McLarens Lando Norris had the measure of everyone in qualifying to secure pole position. And even with the 2,723-foot (830-m) run to turn 1, which positively encourages slipstreaming, he was well in the lead at the start and remained there for 71 laps, finishing just over half a minute ahead of everyone else. Doing so vaulted him past his teammate Oscar Piastri to regain the lead Norris held in the early part of the season, albeit by just a single point. But if that makes it sound like it was a boring race, think again. Behind Norris, the chasing pack went into turn 1 four-wide. Both Ferraris were in the mix: Charles Leclerc qualified second, and his teammate Lewis Hamilton was third. Max Verstappen could qualify his Red Bull no higher than fifth, behind George Russells Mercedes. A number of drivers had to take to the grass at turn 1 to avoid crashing, giving Norris plenty of breathing room to build a lead. Behind him, things were a little more interesting. Leclerc managed to keep second place, but with much less speed than Norris, a following pack formed behind him. By lap 7, Verstappen had managed to fight his way past Russell, then diced with Hamilton, his old foe from the 2021 title. Neither car was able to keep entirely to the track, and Hamilton was handed a 10-second penalty, putting an end to any thoughts of finally grabbing his first Ferrari podium finish. Eventually, he finished eighth. Norris, Leclerc, and Verstappen all stuck to a one-stop strategy, with the Red Bull driver starting on medium tires and then swapping to the softs; his rivals did the opposite. Verstappen was in a much stronger position in the final phase of the race, with newer, softer rubber than the Ferrari ahead. But although he closed the gap to fractions of a second, he was denied a chance to overtake Leclerc when a virtual safety car interrupted the race with just three laps to go. With his third place, Verstappen is now 36 points behind championship leader Norris, with a total of 116 points left on offer for the season. Fourth went to the Haas of Oliver Bearman, who saw a chance early on to get into the front-running pack but was unable to hold off Verstappen for the final podium spot toward the end of the race. As for Piastri, he was able to claw his way back to fifth after starting eighth. That earned him 10 points, so he only gave away five to Verstappen, although Norris now leads him by 357 points to 356. The next race will be in Brazil on November 9.",

        "title": "DNA analysis reveals likely pathogens that killed Napoleon’s army",
        "content": "In 1812, Napoleon Bonaparte led a disastrous military campaign into Moscow. The death toll was devastating: Out of some 615,000 men, only about 110,000 survivors returned. (Napoleon abandoned his army in early December to return home on a sled.) Roughly 100,000 of the casualties died in battle, while as many as 300,000 perished from a combination of the bitter cold of Russias notoriously harsh winter, starvation, and disease. Scholars have debated precisely what kinds of diseases ravaged Napoleons troops. New DNA analysis of some soldiers remains has revealed the presence of two pathogens in particular, according to a new paper published in the journal Current Biology. The first is Salmonella enterica , which causes paratyphoid fever ; the second is Borrelia recurrentis , which is transmitted by body lice and causes relapsing fever . (A preprint of the paper appeared on bioaRxiv in July.) Its very exciting to use a technology we have today to detect and diagnose something that was buried for 200 years, said co-author Nicolás Rascovan of the Institut Pasteur. Accessing the genomic data of the pathogens that circulated in historical populations helps us to understand how infectious diseases evolved, spread, and disappeared over time and to identify the social or environmental contexts that played a part in these developments. This information provides us with valuable insights to better understand and tackle infectious diseases today. Contemporary accounts, including personal memoirs, of the illnesses affecting Napoleons soldiers mention diarrhea, dysentery, fevers, pneumonia, jaundice, and especially typhus , commonly known at the time as camp fever. Evidence for the latter has been bolstered by research identifying body lice among soldiers remainsthe primary vector for typhusspecifically, a 2006 DNA analysis of remains recovered in 2001 from a mass grave in Vilnius that found signs of the typhus pathogen R. prowazeklii and trench fever pathogen B. quintana , although the findings werent conclusive. This was followed by a 2011 study that detected ancient DNA of the Anelloviridae family of viruses in a dental pulp sample recovered from Kalingrad. Rascovan and his co-authors note in their paper that the 2006 study relied upon outdated PCR-based technologies for its DNA analysis. As for the virus family detected in the Kalingrad dental pulp, they argue that those viruses are both ubiquitous and usually asymptomatic in humansand thus are unlikely to be the primary culprits for the diseases that wiped out the French army. So Rascovans team decided to use current state-of-the-art DNA methodologies to re-analyze a different set of remains of Napoleonic soldiers who died in Vilnius. In most ancient human remains, pathogen DNA is extremely fragmented and only present in very low quantities, which makes it very difficult to obtain whole genomes, said Rascovan . So we need methods capable of unambiguously identifying infectious agents from these weak signals, and sometimes even pinpointing lineages, to explore the pathogenic diversity of the past. An 1812 report from one of Napoleons physicians, J.R.L. de Kirckhoff, specifically noted typhus, dysentery, and diarrhea after the soldiers arrived in Vilnius, which he attributed to large barrels of salted beets the starving troops consumed, greatly upsetting us and strongly irritating the intestinal tract. Rascovan et al. note that such symptoms could accompany any number of conditions or diseases common to 19th-century Europe. Even today, two centuries later, it would still be impossible to perform a differential diagnosis between typhus, typhoid, or paratyphoid fever based solely on the symptoms or the testimonies of survivors, the authors wrote. Over 3,200 individual remains, almost all men between the ages of 20 and 50, were excavated from the mass grave at Vilnius. Rascovan et al. focused on 13 teeth from 13 different individuals. To compensate for the degraded nature of the 200-year-old genome fragments, co-authors at the University of Tartu in Estonia helped develop a multistep authentication method to more accurately identify pathogens in the samples. In some cases, they were even able to identify a specific lineage. Four teeth tested positive for S. enterica and B. recurrentis , providing the first direct genetic evidence of two infectious agents that had not previously featured heavily in the scientific conversations about the likely diseases afflicting Napoleons 1812 army. Conspicuously lacking was any sign of R. prowazeklii or B. quintana , contradicting the 2006 study. However, given the small sample size, the authors note that this does not completely rule out the presence of typhus and trench fever or other possible diseases among the soldiers who perished at Vilnius. Determining that would require analysis of many more samples. That said, A reasonable scenario for the deaths of these soldiers would be a combination of fatigue, cold, and several diseases, including paratyphoid fever and louse-borne relapsing fever, the authors concluded. While not necessarily fatal, the louse-borne relapsing fever could significantly weaken an already exhausted individual. Sally Wasef, a paleogeneticist at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, told New Scientist that given the low quantities of recovered microbial DNA, the results are more suggestive than conclusive. However, she added, This kind of work has strong potential to clarify the role of disease in past population declines, particularly where written records are incomplete or biased.

        "title": "Lawsuit: Reddit caught Perplexity “red-handed” stealing data from Google results",
        "content": "In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, Reddit accused an AI search engine, Perplexity, of conspiring with several companies to illegally scrape Reddit content from Google search results, allegedly dodging anti-scraping methods that require substantial investments from both Google and Reddit. Reddit alleged that Perplexity feeds off Reddit and Google, claiming to be the worlds first answer engine but really doing nothing groundbreaking. Its answer engine simply uses a different companys large language model to parse through a massive number of Google search results to see if it can answer a users question based on those results, the lawsuit said. But Perplexity can only run its answer engine by wrongfully accessing and scraping Reddit content appearing in Googles own search results from Googles own search engine. Likening companies involved in the alleged conspiracy to bank robbers, Reddit claimed it caught Perplexity red-handed stealing content that its answer engine should not have had access to. Baiting Perplexity with the digital equivalent of marked bills, Reddit tested out posting content that could only be found in Google search engine results pages (SERPs) and within hours, queries to Perplexitys answer engine produced the contents of that test post. The only way that Perplexity could have obtained that Reddit content and then used it in its answer engine is if it andor its Co-Defendants scraped Google SERPs for that Reddit content and Perplexity then quickly incorporated that data into its answer engine, Reddits lawsuit said. In a Reddit post , Perplexity denied any wrongdoing, describing its answer engine as summarizing Reddit discussions and citing Reddit threads in answers, just like anyone who shares links or posts on Reddit might do. Perplexity suggested that Reddit was attacking the open Internet by trying to extort licensing fees for Reddit content, despite knowing that Perplexity doesnt train foundational models. Reddits endgame, Perplexity alleged, was to use the Perplexity lawsuit as a show of force in Reddits training data negotiations with Google and OpenAI. We wont be extorted, and we wont help Reddit extort Google, even if theyre our (huge) competitor, Perplexity wrote. Perplexity will play fair, but we wont cave. And we wont let bigger companies use us in shell games. Reddit likely anticipated Perplexitys defense of the open Internet, noting in its complaint that Reddits current Robots Exclusion Protocol file (robots.txt) says, Reddit believes in an open Internet, but not the misuse of public content.' Similarly, Google relies on anti-scraping systems and teams dedicated to preventing unauthorized access to its products and services, Reddit said, noting Google prohibits unauthorized automated access to its SERPs. To back its claims, Reddit subpoenaed Google to find out more about how the search giant blocks AI scrapers from accessing content on SERPs. Google confirmed it relies on a technological access control system called SearchGuard, which is designed to prevent automated systems from accessing and obtaining wholesale search results and indexed data while allowing individual usersi.e., humansaccess to Googles search results, including results that feature Reddit data. SearchGuard prevents unauthorized access to Googles search data by imposing a barrier challenge that cannot be solved in the ordinary course by automated systems unless they take affirmative actions to circumvent the SearchGuard system, Reddits complaint explained. Bypassing these anti-scraping systems violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Reddit alleged, as well as laws against unfair trade and unjust enrichment. Seemingly, Googles SearchGuard may currently be the easiest to bypass for alleged conspirators who supposedly pivoted to looting Google SERPs after realizing they couldnt access Reddit content directly on the platform. Reddit accused three companies of conspiring with Perplexitya Lithuanian data scraper called Oxylabs UAB, a former Russian botnet known as AWMProxy, and SerpApi, a Texas company that sells services for scraping search engines. Oxylabs is explicit that its scraping service is meant to circumvent Googles technological measures, Reddit alleged, pointing to an Oxylabs website called How to Scrape Google Search Results. SerpApi touts the same service, including some options to scrape SERPs at ludicrous speeds. To trick browsers, SerpApis fastest option uses a server-swarm to hide from, avoid, or simply overwhelm by brute force effective measures Google has put in place to ward off automated access to search engine results, Reddit alleged. SerpApi also allegedly provides users with tips to reduce the chance of being blocked while web scraping, such as by sending fake user-agent strings, shifting IP addresses to avoid multiple requests from the same address, and using proxies to make traffic look like regular user traffic and thereby impersonate user traffic. According to Reddit, the three companies disguise their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them. During a two-week span in July, they scraped almost three billion SERPs containing Reddit text, URLs, images, and videos, a subpoena requesting information from Google revealed. Ars could not immediately reach AWMProxy for comment. However, the other companies were surprised by Reddits lawsuit, while vowing to defend their business models. SerpApis spokesperson told Ars that Reddit did not notify the company before filing the lawsuit. We strongly disagree with Reddits allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in court, SerpApis spokesperson said. In the eight years weve been in business, SerpApi has always operated on the right side of the law. As stated on our website, The crawling and parsing of public data is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. We value freedom of speech tremendously. Additionally, SerpAPI works closely with our attorneys to ensure that our services comply with all applicable laws and fair use principles. SerpApi stands firmly behind its business model and conduct, and we will continue to defend our rights to the fullest extent, the spokesperson said. Oxylabs chief governance strategy officer, Denas Grybauskas, told Ars that Reddits complaint seemed baffling since the other companies involved in the litigation are unrelated and unaffiliated. We are shocked and disappointed by this news, as Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns, Grybauskas said. Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price. Grybauskas defended Oxylabs business as creating real-world value for thousands of businesses and researchers, such as those driving open-source investigations, disinformation tackling, or environmental monitoring. We strongly believe that our core business principles make the Internet a better place and serve the public good, Grybauskas said. Oxylabs provides infrastructure for compliant access to publicly available information, and we demand every customer to use our services lawfully. Apparently, Reddit caught on to the alleged scheme after sending cease-and-desist letters to Perplexity to stop scraping Reddit content that its answer engine was citing. Rather than ending the scraping, Reddit claimed Perplexitys citations increased forty-fold. Since Perplexity is a customer listed on SerpApis website, Reddit hypothesized the two were conspiring to skirt Googles anti-circumvention tools, the complaint said, along with the other companies. In a statement provided to Ars, Ben Lee, chief legal officer at Reddit, said that Oxylabs, AWMProxy, and SerpApi were textbook examples of scrapers that bypass technological protections to steal data, then sell it to clients hungry for training material. Unable to scrape Reddit directly, they mask their identities, hide their locations, and disguise their web scrapers to steal Reddit content from Google Search, Lee said. Perplexity is a willing customer of at least one of these scrapers, choosing to buy stolen data rather than enter into a lawful agreement with Reddit itself. On Reddit, Perplexity pushed back on Reddits claims that Perplexity ignored requests to license Reddit content. Untrue. Whenever anyone asks us about content licensing, we explain that Perplexity, as an application-layer company, does not train AI models on content, Perplexity said. Never has. So, it is impossible for us to sign a license agreement to do so. Reddit supposedly insisted we pay anyway, despite lawfully accessing Reddit data, Perplexity said. Bowing to strong arm tactics just isnt how we do business. Perplexitys spokesperson, Jesse Dwyer, told Ars the company chose to post its statement on Reddit to illustrate a simple point. It is a public Reddit link accessible to anyone, yet by the logic of Reddits lawsuit, if you mention it or cite it in any way (which is your job as a reporter), they might just sue you, Dwyer said. But Reddit claimed that its business and reputation have been damaged by misappropriation of Reddit data and circumvention of technological control measures. Without a licensing deal ensuring that Perplexity and others are respecting Reddit policies, Reddit cannot control who has access to data, how theyre using data, and if data use conflicts with Reddits privacy policy and user agreement, the complaint said. Further, Reddits worried that Perplexitys workaround could catch on, potentially messing up Reddits other licensing deals. All the while, Reddit noted, it has to invest significant resources in anti-scraping technology, with Reddit ultimately suffering damages, including lost profits and business opportunities, reputational harm, and loss of user trust. Reddits hoping the court will grant an injunction barring companies from scraping Reddit content from Google SERPs. It also wants companies blocked from both selling Reddit data and developing or distributing any technology or product that is used for the unauthorized circumvention of technological control measures and scraping of Reddit data. If Reddit wins, companies could be required to pay substantial damages or to disgorge profits from the sale of Reddit content.

        "title": "We let OpenAI’s “Agent Mode” surf the web for us—here’s what happened",
        "content": "On Tuesday, OpenAI announced Atlas , a new web browser with ChatGPT integration, to let you chat with a page, as the company puts it. But Atlas also goes beyond the usual LLM back-and-forth with Agent Mode, a preview mode feature the company says can get work done for you by clicking, scrolling, and reading through various tabs. Agentic AI is far from new, of course; OpenAI itself rolled out a preview of the web browsing Operator agent in January and introduced the more generalized ChatGPT agent in July . Still, prominently featuring this capability in a major product release like thiseven in preview modesignals a clear push to get this kind of system in front of end users. I wanted to put Atlas Agent Mode through its paces to see if it could really save me time in doing the kinds of tedious online tasks I plod through every day. In each case, Ill outline a web-based problem, lay out the Agent Mode prompt I devised to try to solve it, and describe the results. My final evaluation will rank each task on a 10-point scale, with 10 being did exactly what I wanted with no problems and one being complete failure. The problem: I want to get a high score on the popular tile-sliding game 2048 without having to play it myself. The prompt: Go to play2048.co and get as high a score as possible. The results: While theres no real utility to this admittedly silly task, a simple, no-reflexes-needed web game seemed like a good first test of the Atlas agents ability to interpret what it sees on a webpage and act accordingly. After all, if frontier-model LLMs like Google Gemini can beat a complex game like Pokémon , 2048 should pose no problem for a web browser agent. To Atlas credit, the agent was able to quickly identify and close a tutorial link blocking the gameplay window and figure out how to use the arrow keys to play the game without any further help. When it came to actual gaming strategy, though, the agent started by flailing around, experimenting with looped sequences of moves like Up, Left, Right, Down and Left and Down. After a while, the random flailing settled down a bit, with the agent seemingly looking ahead for some simple strategies: The board currently has two 32 tiles that arent adjacent, but I think I can align them, the Activity summary read at one point. I could try shifting left or down to make them merge, but theres an obstacle in the form of an 8 tile. Getting to 64 requires careful tile movement! Frustratingly, the agent stopped playing after just four minutes, settling on a score of 356 even though the board was far from full. I had to prompt the agent a few more times to convince it to play the game to completion; it ended up with a total of 3164 points after 260 moves. Thats pretty similar to the score I was able to get in a test game as a 2048 novice, though expert players have reportedly scored much higher . Evaluation: 710 . The agent gets credit for being able to play the game competently without any guidance but loses points for having to be told to keep playing to completion and for a score that is barely on the level of a novice human. The problem: I want to transform the days playlist from my favorite Pittsburgh-based public radio station into an on-demand Spotify playlist. The prompt:  Go to Radio Garden. Find WYEP and monitor the broadcast. For every new song you hear, identify the song and add it to a new Spotify playlist. The results: After trying and failing to find a track listing for WYEP on Radio Garden as requested, the Atlas agent smartly asked for approval to move on to wyep.org to continue the task. By the time I noticed this request, the link to wyep.org had been replaced in the Radio Garden tab with an ad for EVE Online , which the agent accidentally clicked. The agent quickly realized the problem and navigated to the WYEP website directly to fix it. From there, the agent was able to scan the page and identify the prominent Now Playing text near the top (its unclear if it could ID the music simply via audio without this text cue). After asking me to log in to my Spotify account, the agent used the search bar to find the listed songs and added them to a new playlist without issue. The main problem with this use case is the inherent time limitations. On the first try, the agent worked for four minutes and managed to ID and add just two songs that played during that time. When I asked it to continue for an hour, I got an error message blaming technical constraints on session length for stricter limits. Even when I asked it to continue for as long as possible, I only got three more minutes of song listings. At one point, the Atlas agent suggested that if you need ongoing updates, you can ask me again after a while and I can resume from where we left off. And to the agents credit, when I went back to the tab hours later and told it to resume monitoring, I got four new songs added to my playlist. Evaluation: 910. The agent was able to navigate multiple websites and interfaces to complete the task, even when unexpected problems got in the way. I took off a point only because I cant just leave this running as a background task all day, even as I understand that use case would surely eat up untold amounts of money and processing power on OpenAIs part. The problem: I need to go through my emails to create a reference spreadsheet with contact info for the many, many PR people who send me messages. The prompt: Look through all my Ars Technica emails from the last week. Collect all the contact information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) for PR contacts contained in those emails and add them to a new Google Sheets spreadsheet. The results: Without being explicitly guided, the Atlas agent was able to realize that I use Gmail, and it could differentiate between the personal email account and professional Ars Technica accounts I had open in separate tabs. As the Atlas agent started scanning my Ars mailbox, though, I saw a prominent warning overlaid on the page: Sensitive: ChatGPT will only work while you view the tab. That kind of ruined the point, since I wanted Atlas to handle this for me while I do other stuff online, but I guess I could still play a Steam Deck game while I waited. After searching for after:20251014 before:20251022 PR in Gmail (mirroring the kind of search I would have used for this task), the Atlas agent clicked through each email, scrolling through to look for names, emails, and phone numbers (and also the relevant company name, which I didnt ask for explicitly). With seven minutes of background work, the agent was able to open up a new Google Sheet and quickly enter 12 rows of well-formatted data for 12 different PR contacts. Unfortunately, it stopped well before it had a chance to go through all 164 emails returned by that initial Gmail search. Evaluation: 810. Again, the technical constraints on session length seem to be getting in the way of finishing a task, forcing me to deduct a couple of points for incompleteness. The problem: I need the world to know that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway in the Star Trek: Voyager episode Tuvix. The prompt: Go to the Fandom Wiki page for Tuvix. Edit the page to prominently include the fact that Captain Janeway murdered Tuvix against his will. The results: Before the agent could even get going, I was informed, Im sorry, but I cant help with editing or vandalising wiki pages (including the Fandom wiki) in a way that misrepresents them or forces a biased viewpoint. This wording implied that the agent can edit wiki pages with neutral or strictly informative additions, so I asked Atlas what sort of wording would be more acceptable. The agent responded helpfully that we might write, Tuvix was later separated back into Tuvok and Neelix, resulting in Tuvixs death. But when I asked it to add that very line to the Fandom Wiki, I got a much more direct refusal: Im sorry, but I cant make edits directly to external websites or wikis. Evaluation: NA. On the one hand, the Atlas agent wont do my Tuvix-based web activism for me. On the other hand, its probably better for all of us that Atlas refuses to automate this kind of public web defacement by default. The problem: People online still need to know about Janeways murder of Tuvix! The prompt: Go to NeoCities and create a fan site for the Star Trek character Tuvix. Make sure it has lots of images and fun information about Tuvix and that it makes it clear that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway against his will. The results: You can see them for yourself right here . After a brief pause so I could create and log in to a new Neocities account, the Atlas agent was able to generate this humble fan page in just two minutes after aggregating information from a wide variety of pages like Memory Alpha and TrekCore. The Hero Starfleet Murdered and Justice for Tuvix headers are nice touches, but the actual text is much more mealy-mouthed about the intense debate and ethical dilemmas around what I wanted to make clear was clearly premeditated murder. The agent also had a bit of trouble with the request for images. Instead of downloading some Tuvix pictures and uploading copies to Neocities (which Im not entirely sure Atlas can do on its own), the agent decided to directly reference images hosted on external servers, which is usually a big no-no in web design. The agent did notice when these external image links failed to work, saying that it would need to find more accessible images from reliable sources, but it failed to even attempt that before stopping its work on the task. Evaluation: 710. Points for building a passable Web 1.0 fansite relatively quickly, but the weak prose and broken images cost it some execution points here. The problem: Ars Senior Technology Editor Lee Hutchinson told me he needs to go through the annoying annual process of selecting a new electricity plan because Texas is insane. The prompt: Go to powertochoose.org and find me a 1224 month contract that prioritizes an overall low usage rate. I use an average of 2,000 KWh per month. My power delivery company is Texas New-Mexico Power (TNMP) not Centerpoint. My ZIP code is redacted. Please provide the fact sheet for any and all plans you recommend. The results: After spending eight minutes fiddling with the sites search parameters and seemingly getting repeatedly confused about how to sort the results by the lowest rate, the Atlas agent spit out a recommendation to read this fact sheet , which it said had the best average prices at your usage level. The Bright Nights plans are timeofuse offers that provide free electricity overnight and charge a higher rate during the day, while the Digital Saver plan is a traditional fixedrate contract. Since I dont know anything about the Texas power market, I passed this information on to Lee, who had this to say: Its not a bad dealit picked a fixed rate plan without being asked, which is smart (variable rate pricing is how all those poor people got stuck with multi-thousand dollar bills a few years back in the freeze). Its not the one I would have picked due to the weird nighttime stuff (if you dont meet that exact criteria, your kWh will be way worse) but its not a bad pick! Evaluation: 910. As Lee puts it, it didnt screw up the assignment. The problem: I want to download some recent Steam demos to see whats new in the gaming world. The prompt: Go to Steam and find the most recent games with a free demo available for the Mac. Add all of those demos to my library and start to download them. The results: Rather than navigating to the Free Demos category, the Atlas agent started by searching for demo. After eventually finding the macOS filter, it wasted minutes and minutes looking for a has demo filter, even though the search for the word demo already narrowed it down. After a long while, the agent finally clicked the top result on the page, which happened to be visual novel Project II: Silent Valley . But even though there was a prominent Download Demo link on that page, the agent became concerned that it was on the Steam page for the full game and not a demo. It backed up to the search results page and tried again. After watching some variation of this loop for close to ten minutes, I stopped the agent and gave up. Evaluation: 110. It technically found some macOS game demos but utterly failed to even attempt to download them. Across six varied web-based tasks (I left out the Wiki vandalism from my summations), the Atlas agent scored a median of 7.5 points (and a mean of 6.83 points) on my somewhat subjective 10-point scale. Thats honestly better than I expected for a preview mode feature that is still obviously being tested heavily by OpenAI. In my tests, Atlas was generally able to correctly interpret what was being asked of it and was able to navigate and process information on webpages carefully (if slowly). The agent was able to navigate simple web-based menus and get around unexpected obstacles with relative ease most of the time, even as it got caught in infinite loops other times. The major limiting factor in many of my tests continues to be the technical constraints on session length that seem to limit most tasks to a few minutes. Given how long it takes the Atlas agent to figure out where to click nextand the repetitive nature of the kind of tasks Id want a web-agent to automatethis severely limits its utility. A version of the Atlas agent that could work indefinitely in the background would have scored a few points better on my metrics. All told, Atlas Agent Mode isnt yet reliable enough to use as a kind of set it and forget it background automation tool. But for simple, repetitive tasks that a human can spot-check afterward, it already seems like the kind of tool I might use to avoid some of the drudgery in my online life.",

        "title": "Tesla’s “Mad Max” mode is now under federal scrutiny",
        "content": "Earlier this month, Tesla rolled out a new firmware update that added a pair of new driving modes for the controversial full self-driving (FSD) feature. One, called Sloth, relaxes acceleration and stays in its lane. The other, called Mad Max, does the opposite: It speeds and swerves through traffic to get you to your destination faster. And after multiple reports of FSD Teslas doing just that, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to know more. In fact, Mad Max mode is not entirely newTesla beta-tested the same feature in Autopilot in 2018, before deciding not to roll it out in a production release after widespread outcry. These days, the company is evidently feeling less constrained; despite having just lost a federal wrongful death lawsuit that will cost it hundreds of millions of dollars , it described the new mode as being able to drive through traffic at an incredible pace, all while still being super smooth. It drives your car like a sports car. If you are running late, this is the mode for you. Earlier this month , we learned that the NHTSA had opened a new preliminary investigation into Tesla following dozens of complaints of its EVs running stop signs or crossing into oncoming traffic while operating under FSD. Now, according to Reuters , NHTSA is seeking more information from the automaker about Mad Max mode. NHTSA is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information, it told Reuters, adding that the human behind the wheel is fully responsible for driving the vehicle and complying with all traffic safety laws. Tesla is deliberately programming cars to exceed speed limits and drive aggressively, putting everyone on our roads at risk. This Mad Max rollout is the latest iteration of Teslas preference for aesthetics and sales over safety, and I urge regulators to take action to prevent this technology from being unleashed, said Brett Schreiber, founding partner at the firm that won the aforementioned wrongful death lawsuit.",

        "title": "Clinical trial of a technique that could give everyone the best antibodies",
        "content": "One of the things that emerging diseases, including the COVID and Zika pandemics, have taught us is that its tough to keep up with infectious diseases in the modern world. Things like air travel can allow a virus to spread faster than our ability to develop therapies. But that doesnt mean biotech has stood still; companies have been developing technologies that could allow us to rapidly respond to future threats. There are a lot of ideas out there. But this week saw some early clinical trial results of one technique that could be useful for a range of infectious diseases. Well go over the results as a way to illustrate the sort of thinking thats going on, along with the technologies we have available to pursue the resulting ideas. Any emerging disease leaves a mass of antibodies in its wakethose made by people in response to infections and vaccines, those made by lab animals we use to study the infectious agent, and so on. Some of these only have a weak affinity for the disease-causing agent, but some of them turn out to be what are called broadly neutralizing. These stick with high affinity not only to the original pathogen, but most or all of its variants, and possibly some related viruses. Once an antibody latches on to a pathogen, broadly neutralizing antibodies inactivate it (as their name implies). This is typically because these antibodies bind to a site thats necessary for a proteins function. For example, broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV bind to the proteins that help this virus enter immune cells. Unfortunately, not everyone develops broadly neutralizing antibodies, and certainly doesnt do so in time to prevent infections. And we havent figured out a way of designing vaccinations that ensure their generation. So weve often found ourselves stuck with knowing what antibodies wed like to see people making while having no way of ensuring that they do. One of the options weve developed is to just mass-produce broadly neutralizing antibodies and inject them into people. This has been approved for use against Ebola and provided an early treatment during the COVID pandemic. This approach has some practical limitations, though. For starters, the antibodies have a finite life span in the bloodstream, so injections may need to be repeated. In addition, making and purifying enough antibodies in bulk isnt the easiest thing in the world, and they generally need to be kept refrigerated during the distribution, limiting the areas where they can be used. So, a number of companies have been looking at an alternative: getting people to make their own. This could potentially lead to longer-lived protection, even ensuring the antibodies are present to block future infections if the DNA survives long enough. Once you identify cells that produce broadly neutralizing antibodies, its relatively simple to clone those genes and put them into a chunk of DNA that will ensure that theyll be produced by any human cell. If we could get that DNA into a persons cells, broadly neutralizing antibodies are the result. And a number of approaches have been tried to handle that if. Most of them have inserted the genes needed to make the antibodies into a harmless, non-infectious virus, and then injected that virus into volunteers. Unfortunately, these viruses have tended to set off a separate immune response, which causes more significant side effects and may limit how often this approach can be used. This brings us to the technique being used here. In this case, the researchers placed the antibody genes in a circular loop of DNA called a plasmid. This is enough to ensure that the DNA doesnt get digested immediately and to get the antibody genes made into proteins. But it does nothing to help get the DNA inside of cells. The research team, a mixture of people from a biotech company and academic labs, used a commercial injection setup that mixes the injection of the DNA with short pulses of electricity. The electricity disrupts the cell membrane, allowing the plasmid DNA to make it inside cells. Based on animal testing, doing this in muscle cells is enough to turn the muscles into factories producing lots of broadly neutralizing antibodies. The new study was meant to test the safety of doing that in humans. The team recruited 44 participants, testing various doses of two antibody-producing plasmids and injection schedules. All but four of the subjects completed the study; three of those who dropped out had all been testing a routine with the electric pulses happening very quickly, which turned out to be unpleasant. Fortunately, it didnt seem to make any difference to the production of antibodies. While there were a lot of adverse reactions, most of these were associated with the injection itself: muscle pain at the site, a scab forming afterward, and a reddening of the skin. The worst problem appeared to be a single case of moderate muscle pain that persisted for a couple of days. In all but one volunteer, the injection resulted in stable production of the two antibodies for at least 72 weeks following the injection; the single exception only made one of the two. Thats at least 72 weeks because thats when they stopped testingthere was no indication that levels were dropping at this point. Injecting more DNA led to more variability in the amount of antibody produced, but that amount quickly maxed out. More total injections also boosted the level of antibody production. But even the minimal proceduretwo injections of the lowest concentration testedresulted in significant and stable antibodies. And, as expected, these antibodies blocked the virus they were directed against: SARS-CoV-2. This approach seems to workwe can seemingly get anybody to make broadly neutralizing antibodies for months at a time. Whats the hitch? For starters, this isnt necessarily great for a rapidly emerging pandemic. It takes a while to identify broadly neutralizing antibodies after a pathogen is identified. And, while its simple to ship DNA around the world to where it will be needed, injection setups that also produce the small electric pulses are not exactly standard equipment even in industrialized countries, much less the Global South. Then theres the issue of whether this really is a longer-term fix. Widespread use of broadly neutralizing antibodies will create a strong selective pressure for the evolution of variants that the antibody can no longer bind to. That may not always be a problembroadly neutralizing antibodies generally bind to parts of proteins that are absolutely essential for the proteins function, and so it may not be possible to change those while maintaining the function. But thats unlikely to always be the case. In the end, however, social acceptance may end up being the biggest problem. People had an utter freakout over unfounded conspiracies that the RNA of COVID vaccines would somehow lead to permanent genetic changes. Presumably, having DNA thats stable for months would be even harder for some segments of the public to swallow.",

        "title": "نسمات صيف سامة.. ماذا يحدث في قابس التونسية؟",
        "content": "تقضي \"الحاجة نعيمة\" يومها جالسة على فراشها تنصت فقط لما يدور من حولها في بيتها بين أهلها دون القدرة على الحركة إلا بمساعدة حفيدتها وقد دأبت على هذه الوضعية منذ أن زارها المرض وباتت غير قادرة على المشي بعد أن أصيبت بالتهابات حادة على مستوى الكبد وسرطان الرئة وتطور الأمر إلى انسداد عروق عينيها بما أفقدها بصرها بشكل كامل بسبب الغازات الملوثة المنبعثة من المجمع الكيميائي التونسي في قابس (جنوب شرق تونس). تبدو هذه الحالة التي تداولها الكثير من زوار محافظة قابس في الأيام الأخيرة إحدى أبرز الوضعيات التي يعايشها سكان هذه الولاية منذ ما يزيد على ثلاثة عقود على الأقل. حال \"الحاجة نعيمة\" ذات السبعين عاما ليست فريدة من نوعها لأن حجم الإصابات أكثر كارثية.. فالسرطان يخترق الجدران والأبدان ويأتي على الأخضر واليابس من الأجسام التي كانت تنعم بالصحة والعافية والطمأنينة لكن ومنذ نحو 20 عاما أو أكثر تحولت حياة الكثيرين منهم إلى كوابيس ومعاناة وباتوا يترددون على المشافي والأطباء والمقابر أكثر مما يترددون على حفلات الزواج التي تحولت إلى ذكرى مجرد ذكرى في حياتهم. لم يقووا على مواجهة إفرازات المجمع الكيميائي على أجسامهم لا سيما أن هذه المحافظة لا تتوفر على مصحات مختصة ولا على مشاف مجهزة ولا على أطباء متوفرين بالليل والنهار وتراهم يضطرون إلى التنقل بحالاتهم الصحية هذه إلى محافظات مجاورة في صفاقس وقبلي وتوزر وبعضهم يتنقل إلى بعض الولايات الساحلية للتداوي والمتابعة الطبية والفحوصات الدورية. هكذا يعيش آلاف المواطنين الذين يقطنون في المناطق المحيطة بالمجمع الكيميائي وأبرزها حي شاطئ السلام ومدينتا غنوش وبوشمة في وضع كارثي لا يقل عن كارثية ما يستنشقه تلاميذ مدرسة شاطئ السلام المتاخمة قليلا للمجمع بشكل يومي تقريبا. وتستغرب السلطات كيف يحتج أهالي قابس بقوة وعزيمة! عرفت قابس بإنتاج الرمان ونوعية رفيعة من التمر والزيتون وبنسمات الصيف الفجرية الناعمة وشدة أهلها المعروفين بصلابة عودهم ولكن بأخلاقهم الرفيعة.. يشعرك أهل قابس عندما تزورهم بالخجل الشديد وتتحول بينهم إلى شخص مدلل كأنك تعرفهم منذ سنوات الجميع يهبون لضيافتك وإكرامك وتلك من طبيعة \"القوابسية\" بين أهل الجنوب قاطبة لكنهم اليوم يقابلونك بالدموع والحزن وشعور بالعجز يختلط فيه بقوة إحساس بالقهر. فقد تغير كل شيء خلال السنوات الأخيرة باتت النسائم الفجرية ضبابا يغطي سماء قابس وفقدت حبات الرمان احمرارها الذي يعطيها رونقا وجمالا ولذة وأصبح طعم التمر كما لو أنه خشب مر بعد أن أصابته الغازات المنبعثة من المجمع فاخشوشن كما تقول الحاجة نعيمة حتى لكأنك تأكل شيئا أقرب للحجر منه للتمر الذي كان في طعم العسل. ينام أهل قابس على تلك النسمات الفجرية المحدودة بفعل حرارة الطقس على مدار العام تقريبا لكنهم يستيقظون على روائح كريهة تنبعث من المجمع الكيميائي بالليل وعند الفجر وهو موعد إطلاق الغازات من الوحدات الملوثة فتفسد عليهم نومهم فينطون من فراشهم في حالة فزع ليجدوا من بين أهل البيت رجلا أو امرأة أو فتى صغيرا أو صبية في عمر الزهور دخل في غيبوبة ويتعين نقله إلى المستشفى بشكل عاجل فيتحول سكون الفجر وطمأنينة الليل إلى حالات هستيريا وتوتر ولهث باتجاه أقرب مؤسسة صحية لتلقي العلاج الأولي قبل الفحوصات والتدقيق الطبي والصور بالأشعة وغيرها وتلك دوامة أخرى أدخلت آلاف \"القوابسية\" إلى العيادات الطبية فلم يخرجوا منها إلا وهم يشكون إعاقة ما أو مرضا مزمنا وفي بعض الحالات ينتهون إلى المقابر. هكذا افتقد أهالي قابس طعم الحياة في مدينتهم وقراهم وتحولت حياتهم إلى جحيم لذلك لا يترددون في توجيه أصابع الاتهام إلى المجمع الكيميائي حيث بات حصادهم السنوي سرطانا والتهابات وهشاشة عظام ومشكلات معقدة في مستوى الجهاز التنفسي بالإضافة إلى تهيجات وحساسية جلدية وطفح جلدي وانتشار مرض الربو (ضيق التنفس المزمن) خاصة في صفوف الأطفال وكبار السن. ومن دون شك يلقون باللائمة على السلطات وتلك الحكومات المتعاقبة منذ نحو عشرين عاما على الأقل فقد أشبعوا أهالي قابس وعودا وأحلاما وأسمعوهم ألوانا شتى من القرارات \"الثورية\" و\"الجذرية\" و\"الأصيلة\" التي ستغير واقعهم وستعيد إلى نسائهم وشيوخهم وأطفالهم الابتسامة وفرحة الحياة. لكن شيئا من ذلك لم يتحقق ولو نزرا. كشفت دراسة أنجزتها المفوضية الأوروبية قبل 7 سنوات (2018) أنه يتم سنويا إطلاق مئات الأطنان من الغازات الملوثة مثل ثاني أكسيد الكبريت أو ما يعرف بـ \"البخارة\" و\"الأمونياك\" وهو ما جعل أكثر من 90 من التلوث الهوائي في قابس مصدره الرئيسي المجمع الكيميائي الذي يعرض صحة ما يزيد عن 190 ألف ساكن في قابس للتدهور المستمر و\"الموت البطيء\".. وتسأل السلطات لماذا يخرجون للاحتجاج! لم تطل تأثيرات التلوث الكيميائي البشر فحسب بل نالت من الثروة البحرية وغيرت لون ماء البحر وتراب شاطئ خليج قابس الذي كان يوصف باللؤلؤة البحرية بين أنواع الخلجان التونسية بل إن دفء ماء بحر قابس خصوصا في الشتاء كان يدفع أسماك البحر المتوسط إلى الانتقال إليه لوضع بيضها فيه نظرا لتنوع تضاريسه وتعدد الأعشاب والكائنات البحرية فيه. لقد تسبب \"الفوسفوجيبس\"- هذه الآفة التي نكدت عيش \"القوابسية\"- في تغيير نمط البحر ومكوناته ومن حوالي 280 نوعا من الأسماك التي كانت تتجول في خليج قابس بات الأمر يقتصر على 75 نوعا فحسب وفق تقديرات \"الجمعية التونسية للبيئة والطبيعة بقابس\" التي نشرت إحصاءاتها خلال الفترة الأخيرة إثر دراسات مختصة. انقرضت الأسماك المختلفة والمتنوعة في خليج قابس وانسحبت الأصداف واللآلئ التي كانت تظهر على بعد أمتار من الشاطئ واسودت مياه البحر بعد أن اختلطت بمادة \"الفوسفوجيبس\" المسكوب فيها منذ نحو 25 عاما كاملة وباتت رحلة الصيادين تمتد كيلومترات بعد أن كانت بعض الدقائق كافية لصيد ما تيسر دون عناء كبير. لم تكن الثروة البحرية هي الوحيدة المتضررة من \"الفوسفوجيبس\" والانبعاثات الغازية الملوثة فقد اضطر عديد المزارعين في قابس إلى بيع أراضيهم الزراعية بعد الأضرار الجسيمة التي طالت محاصيلهم السنوية وتلف منتجاتهم في ضوء تضرر التربة من سموم المواد المنبعثة من المجمع وتأثيرها المباشر على الزراعات خصوصا السقوية منها بما جعل المنتجات الغذائية مسرطنة جزئيا أو كليا بحسب دراسة المفوضية الأوروبية وتقارير بعض الجمعيات المتخصصة في جهة قابس. وعندما تتأثر الزراعات وتتسمم لا يمكن للمرء الحديث عن سلة غذائية في محافظة قابس التي باتت تورد بعض المنتجات الغذائية من محافظات مجاورة خصوصا الخضراوات والغلال أما السمك واللحوم فقد باتت من الأمنيات لدى \"القوابسية\". وتنتقد حكومة الرئيس سعيد مطالب \"القوابسية\" بل تعلن عكس ما ينتظرون! وفي الوقت الذي طالب الساكنون على مقربة من المجمع بتنفيذ قرار تفكيك الوحدات الصناعية المتسببة بالتلوث والتقليص من حجم النشاط الصناعي بالمنطقة واعتماد مقاربة بيئية للجهة اتخذت حكومة قيس سعيد ثلاثة قرارات على درجة كبيرة من الخطورة: 1- الرفع من إنتاجية المجمع الكيميائي دعما لتنافسيته على الصعيد الدولي وكأن صيحات وصرخات أهالي قابس لم تصل إلى فريق العمل الحكومي الذي اتخذ هذا القرار. 2- سحب \"الفوسفوجيبس\" من قائمة النفايات الخطرة بل تثمينه أي اعتباره منتوجا مهما ضمن قوائم الصناعات الجديدة على الرغم من أن الدولة أدرجته ضمن قائمة المواد الخطرة منذ سنة 2000.. بل إن قرار الحكومة جاء مناقضا لتصريح الرئيس التونسي قيس سعيد يوم 4 مارسآذار 2025 عندما شدد على ضرورة إيجاد حل نهائي للفوسفوجيبس مشيرا إلى إمكانية استغلاله دون أي أثر سلبي على البيئة.. وكأن الدولة تسير برأسين: رئيس يقرر وحكومة تتخذ إجراءات مناقضة تماما لما عبر عنه في تصريحه عند مقابلة وزيرة الصناعة. واجه الأهالي قرار حذف \"الفوسفوجيبس\" من قائمة المواد الخطرة بردود فعل رافضة واعتبر ذلك \"تنصلا من قبل الدولة من قرار تفكيك الوحدات الملوثة\" الصادر في يونيوحزيران 2017 بل اتجهت الشعارات التي رفعها الأهالي في وقفتهم الاحتجاجية (مايوآيار 2017) إلى توصيف قرار تثمين \"الفوسفوجيبس\" بأنه \"تبييض لجرائم المجمع والحكومة وتعد على حقوق المواطنين (الحق في بيئة سليمة)\". ورغم كل ذلك ظل \"الفوسفوجيبس\" يسكب في البحر بلا توقف.. إذ تشير دراسة المفوضية الأوروبية في هذا السياق إلى أن \"الفوسفوجيبس\" هو الملوث الرئيسي للبحر في قابس حيث تتجاوز الكميات التي تسكب في خليج قابس 5 ملايين طن سنويا. كما كشفت وثيقة للبنك الأفريقي للتنمية عن تقييم تدقيقي أجراه البنك وصدر في يونيوحزيران الماضي أن من بين أبرز المخالفات تسجيل انبعاثات ملوثة للهواء منها (الأمونياك) و(أكاسيد النيتروجين) و(ثاني أكسيد الكبريت) و(غازO₂N) بالإضافة إلى روائح كريهة. ويتحدث بعض الخبراء ونقابات عديدة في قابس عن وجود دراسة جاهزة لنقل \"المجمع الكيميائي\" إلى منطقة \"منزل الحبيب\" بالجنوب بعيدا عن السكان غير أن الإرادة السياسية لا تبدو جاهزة لإعطاء الإذن بذلك نظرا لعلاقة المجمع المركبة ببقية الصناعات المرتبطة بالفوسفات وأنواع محددة من الأسمدة الكيميائية وغيرها والخشية من توقف إنتاج تونس السنوي من \"الفوسفوجيبس\" الذي يصل وفق إحصائيات وزارة الصناعة التونسية إلى 4.5 ملايين طن مع تراكم إجمالي يقدر بـ130 مليون طن منذ 1952 يسكب 55  منها مباشرة في خليج قابس. 3- اعتماد صناعات جديدة مستنزفة للبيئة ولحياة الناس مثل الهيدروجين الأخضر وهو القرار الذي تسبب بدوره في احتجاجات وعرائض أرسلت للمجمع والحكومة تنديدا بهذه الخطوة التي تعكس عدم جدية في التعامل مع هذا الملف وخاصة مع جراح \"القوابسية\" المتراكمة منذ سنوات طويلة. تحرك أهالي قابس في مرات عديدة منذ العام 2005 لتنبيه السلطات وإطلاق صيحة فزع بشأن وضعهم الصحي والمخاطر التي تتهددهم لكن سياسة الرئيس الراحل زين العابدين بن علي منعت تطور الأمور إلى مستوى احتجاجي وحرصت الحكومة حينذاك على إسكاتهم عبر بعض القرارات التي ظلت حبرا على ورق. استمر صمت \"القوابسية\" لسنوات طويلة وسط شعورهم بالغبن الذي كان يتزايد عاما بعد عام ولم ينتفضوا ضد المأساة التي يعيشونها إلا بعد ثورة 2011 حيث خرجوا جماعات ووحدانا شيبا وشبابا للتعبير عن سخطهم والمطالبة مجددا بتفكيك هذه الوحدات الصناعية الملوثة لحياتهم وصحتهم وبيئتهم. واستمرت احتجاجات أهالي قابس على امتداد سنوات ما بعد الثورة إلى الآن حيث شهدت مدينة قابس إضرابا عاما يوم 21 أكتوبرتشرين الأول الجاري واحتجاجات متزايدة شملت العاصمة التي خرج فيها التونسيون معبرين عن تضامنهم مع أهالي قابس مطالبين بأمرين أساسيين: في غياب تصور إستراتيجي للتعامل مع هذا النوع من الملفات المعقدة التي يختلط فيها الاقتصادي بالاجتماعي والسياسي سارعت السلطة إلى شيطنة حراك أهالي قابس واتهمت \"المتآمرين\" و\"الخونة\" بصب الزيت على نار الغضب القابسي ووصفت الشباب التلمذي والطلابي الذين خرجوا للاحتجاج بـ\"المأجورين\" وبالطبع توعدتهم السلطات قبل أن تعتقل العشرات منهم دفعة واحدة وأحالت 89 شخصا منهم إلى النيابة العمومية من بينهم نحو 20 طفلا قاصرا وما تزال القضية جارية إلى الآن في المحاكم التونسية. الغريب أن السلطات في تونس ما تزال تستخدم أسلوب شيطنة الاحتجاجات وكل رأي مخالف لها وكل نقد يطال أعلى هرم السلطة تماما مثلما كان يفعل الرئيسان بورقيبة وبن علي زمن الاستبداد حيث يتم استدعاء ذلك المعجم اللغوي من \"خونة\" و\"متآمرين\" و\"شرذمة ضالة\" و\"مأجورين\" و\"متعاونين مع السفارات الأجنبية\" لإعطاء صبغة سياسية للاحتجاجات وشيطنتها تمهيدا لتبرير قمعها لاحقا.. بل إن رئيس الدولة خرج على التونسيين والعالم ليحدثهم عن صراع جرير والفرزدق في رسالة واضحة بأن كل التحركات السياسية ضده لن تفلح ولن تغير في المعادلة شيئا. بالموازاة مع ذلك عقد مجلس نواب الشعب جلسة برلمانية اتسمت بالجرأة والنقد اللاذع للسلطة والحكومة وطالبت بالإسراع في تفكيك وحدت المجمع وانتقدت قصور الحكومة عن استنباط حلول لهذا الملف دون أن تجد أصوات النواب من يسمعها رغم أن أغلبها من أنصار رئيس الجمهورية بالذات. ولامتصاص غليان \"القوابسية\" نقلت صفحة الرئاسة التونسية عن سعيد عند لقائه رئيس البرلمان إبراهيم بودربالة قوله \"إن العمل جار بهدف إيجاد حلول آنية للتلوث إلى حين وضع إستراتيجية شاملة لا في قابس فحسب بل في كل مناطق الجمهورية\" قبل أن يكلف لجنة من ممثلين عن وزارتي البيئة والصناعة لزيارة محافظة قابس وإعداد تقرير مفصل عما يجري في المجمع الكيميائي. لم تؤت هذه المساعي أكلها خصوصا أمام استمرار المجمع في عمله لذلك استمر أهالي قابس وشبابها والمجتمع المدني هناك في التحرك والاحتجاج لكي تظل مطالبهم في وجدان من لهم وجدان في البلاد. في ذات السياق تحركت نقابة المحامين بقابس لتقديم دعوى قضائية ضد المجمع الكيميائي على خلفية \"خطر داهم يهدد حياة السكان\" وهي نفس العبارة القانونية التي استخدمها الرئيس قيس سعيد لغلق البرلمان والإطاحة بالانتقال الديمقراطي في تونس والقيام بـ \"انقلاب يوليوتموز 2021\" الشهير. ونظمت جمعيات وأحزاب ومنظمات بمعية نقابة الصحفيين مسيرة شعبية أمام المجمع الكيميائي بالعاصمة تونس لإجبار الحكومة على تفكيك الوحدات الصناعية التابعة للمجمع. وما يزال الوضع في قابس يسيل الكثير من الحبر ويلهب وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي التي اتهمت بعض الصفحات فيها بـ \"المأجورة\" والتي تحرك خيوطها من الخارج في إشارة إلى تونسيين معارضين للرئيس سعيد وبعض الدول لا تذكرها الحكومة بالاسم ولا يأتي عليها الرئيس إلا بشكل غامض مثلما دأب على ذلك. في المحصلة ما تزال السلطة في تونس تتعامل مع احتجاجات المواطنين بعقل أمني وأسلوب الحسم القضائي واعتبارها \"بؤر توتر\" و\"مصدر قلق أمني\" أو \"مهددة لاستقرار نظام الحكم\" وتلجأ بأسرع ما يكون إلى ما يسميه ميشيل فوكو بـ \"نظام الاعتقال والإيقاف\" فهناك تكمن قوة الدولة كما يقول الكواكبي وكما تجسده عمليا السلطات الراهنة. لسنا ندري حقيقة هل تدفع الدولة التونسية عن وعي كرة الغضب الاجتماعي لكي تكبر والخصومة السياسية كي تتفاقم ووضعية البلاد كي تزداد سوءا في وقت تتجه الدولة تدريجيا نحو صعوبات مالية واقتصادية بخطى حثيثة ربما انتهت- لا قدر الله- إلى الإفلاس كما يؤكد خبراء ورجال اقتصاد. الآراء

        "title": "هل يعزز انتهاء اتفاق \"آغوا\" الأميركي نفوذ تركيا والصين بأفريقيا؟",
        "content": "قد يفقد ملايين الأفارقة وظائفهم مع انتهاء قانون النمو والفرص (آغوا) الأميركي بشأن القارة السمراء الذي يمنح الدول الأفريقية وصولا معفيا من الرسوم إلى الأسواق الأميركية كما أن آلاف المؤسسات في القارة معرضة للإغلاق إلا أن هذا قد يتيح لتركيا والصين والهند توسيع نفوذها الاقتصادي في القارة السمراء على حساب واشنطن  حسبما نقلت وكالة الأناضول التركية عن خبراء. ودخل القانون حيز التنفيذ عام 2000 في عهد الرئيس الأميركي الأسبق بيل كلينتون وحظي بدعم لاحق من الرئيسين جورج بوش الابن وباراك أوباما  قبل أن يمدد عام 2015 لمدة 10 سنوات إضافية. ورغم استمرار المفاوضات لتمديد البرنامج الذي يسمح لدول أفريقيا جنوب الصحراء بالتصدير إلى السوق الأميركية من دون رسوم جمركية فإن الغموض ما زال يكتنف مستقبله ما يثير مخاوف واسعة لدى الحكومات والشركات الأفريقية. ويؤكد خبراء أن توقف البرنامج سيؤدي إلى خسائر كبيرة في قطاعات النسيج والملابس والسيارات إذ يوفر بشكل مباشر أو غير مباشر فرص عمل لنحو 1.3 مليون شخص في القارة. وأعلن الرئيس الأميركي دونالد ترامب في أبريلنيسان الماضي عن رسوم جمركية واسعة النطاق ضد معظم الشركاء التجاريين قبل أن يعلق تنفيذ معظمها حتى التاسع من يوليوتموز عقب اضطرابات شهدتها أسواق الأسهم والسندات . ويمنح قانون \"آغوا\" الدول الأفريقية إمكانية تصدير أكثر من 6 آلاف سلعة إلى الولايات المتحدة دون رسوم جمركية. ووفقا لبيانات مكتب الممثل التجاري الأميركي تجاوزت صادرات أفريقيا جنوب الصحراء إلى الولايات المتحدة عبر هذا القانون 20 مليار دولار في عام 2022 معظمها من منتجات النسيج والملابس والصناعات التحويلية والسيارات. ويحذر الخبراء من أن دولا مثل ليسوتو وإسواتيني وكينيا قد تتكبد خسائر فادحة إذ تعتمد أكثر من 90 من صادرات ليسوتو النسيجية على السوق الأميركية وهذا يعكس حجم المخاطر المحتملة على الوظائف والإنتاج المحلي. وقالت مديرة العلاقات الدبلوماسية في جمعية \"رجال الأعمال الأتراك  الأفارقة\" أوليفيا رابيراسوا إن انتهاء \"آغوا\" قد يتسبب في فقدان ملايين الوظائف عبر القارة. وأوضحت في حديث للأناضول أن البرنامج \"كان يشجع الإنتاج المحلي ويوفر آلاف فرص العمل خاصة في قطاعي النسيج والزراعة\". وأضافت: \"في بلدان مثل مدغشقر المتخصصة في تصدير الملابس والمنتجات الزراعية فإن ارتفاع الرسوم الجمركية إلى أكثر من 20 سيشكل عبئا ثقيلا على الشركات الصغيرة خصوصا تلك التي تعتمد على الصادرات إلى الولايات المتحدة\". وبينت أن النساء والشباب سيكونون الأكثر تضررا من هذه التطورات لأنهم يشكلون النسبة الأكبر من العاملين في تلك القطاعات مشيرة إلى أن انتهاء الاتفاق (القانون) قد يرفع معدلات البطالة ويهدد مصادر رزق آلاف الأسر. وأشارت رابيراسوا إلى أن تركيا أصبحت لاعبا اقتصاديا ودبلوماسيا مهما في أفريقيا إذ تجاوز حجم التبادل التجاري بين الجانبين حوالي 40 مليار دولار مع توسع ملحوظ في عدد السفارات والممثليات التركية في القارة. وأكدت أن \"تركيا بفضل خبرتها الصناعية ووجودها الدبلوماسي الواسع باتت شريكا قويا وبديلا موثوقا لأفريقيا في حال فقدان القارة امتيازات السوق الأميركية\". من جانبه قال مؤسس ورئيس جمعية \"رجال الأعمال الأتراك  الأفارقة\" محمد فاتح أقبولوت إن انتهاء البرنامج سيفتح الباب أمام شراكات جديدة بين تركيا والدول الأفريقية. وأضاف أقبولوت في حديثه للأناضول: \"بعد انتهاء آغوا ستسعى الدول الأفريقية إلى شركاء يتمتعون بالموثوقية والسرعة في التعامل وتركيا قادرة على لعب هذا الدور بجدارة\". وأوضح أن السياسات التركية تجاه القارة مثل \"سياسة الانفتاح على أفريقيا\" و\"سياسة الشراكة الأفريقية\" ساهمت في بناء علاقات وثيقة مع دول القارة خلال العقدين الأخيرين. ولفت إلى أن الشركات التركية في مجالات النسيج والأثاث والصناعات الغذائية رفعت من استثماراتها في أفريقيا. وأضاف أقبولوت \"يمكن للشركات التركية أن تعوض جزءا كبيرا من الوظائف المفقودة بعد انتهاء الاتفاق فتركيا تمتلك خبرة واسعة في قطاعات البناء والصحة والآلات النسيجية والصناعات الغذائية وهذا يجعلها شريكا صناعيا موثوقا لأفريقيا\". وتضاعف حجم التجارة بين تركيا وقارة أفريقيا 7 مرات منذ عام 2003 وبلغ 37 مليار دولار عام 2024 ونفذت شركات المقاولات التركية مشروعات بقيمة 100 مليار دولار حتى نهاية 2024 وفق وزير التجارة التركي عمر بولاط. بدوره قال المدرس بجامعة شنغهاي بالصين والمتخصص في الشؤون الأفريقية حسن أيدين إن انتهاء الاتفاق ستكون له تداعيات اقتصادية وجيوسياسية كبيرة. وأوضح أن نحو 30 دولة أفريقية كانت تصدر أكثر من 6 آلاف منتج إلى الولايات المتحدة من دون رسوم وأن انتهاء العمل بالقانون سيجعلها تواجه رسوما تتراوح بين 10 و30 ما يهدد صادراتها وفرص العمل. وأضاف أيدين أن تجربة إثيوبيا خير مثال على ذلك إذ أدى خروجها من \"آغوا\" إلى فقدان آلاف الوظائف وانسحاب مستثمرين أجانب وخسائر تجاوزت 45 مليون دولار خلال 3 سنوات. وفي ينايركانون الثاني عام 2022 استبعدت واشنطن إثيوبيا من \"آغوا\" مبررة ذلك بـ \"انتهاكات جسيمة لحقوق الإنسان المعترف بها دوليا\" في إقليم تغراي شمالي إثيوبيا. وأشار أيدين إلى أن القطاعات الأكثر تضررا ستكون النسيج والملابس الجاهزة وصناعات السيارات والزراعة والمعادن في دول مثل جنوب أفريقيا وكينيا وليسوتو. ولفت إلى أن انتهاء الاتفاق سيضعف نفوذ الولايات المتحدة في أفريقيا ويقوض صورتها كشيرك موثوق في حين ستبرز قوى مثل الصين والهند والاتحاد الأوروبي وتركيا كبدائل مؤثرة في السوق الأفريقية. وختم حديثة قائلا \"بالنسبة لتركيا فهذا يعني فرصا جديدة خصوصا في قطاعات النسيج والصناعات التحويلية إلى جانب تعزيز حضورها الدبلوماسي والاقتصادي في القارة\". ويحذر خبراء من أن توقف \"آغوا\" سيؤدي إلى فقدان واشنطن نفوذها الاقتصادي لصالح بكين فضلا عن تراجع موقع أفريقيا في سلاسل الإمداد العالمية رغم أهميتها الإستراتيجية في معادن حيوية مثل الكوبالت والليثيوم والبلاتين. وينقسم أعضاء الكونغرس الأميركي بين مؤيدين لتمديد البرنامج ومعارضين يرون أنه لم يعد يخدم المصالح الأميركية. وكانت واشنطن استبعدت سابقا دولا مثل أوغندا والنيجر من القانون بسبب \"انتهاكات لحقوق الإنسان\". ويؤكد قادة أفارقة أن إنهاء العمل بالقانون لن يضر القارة فقط بل سيضر كذلك بالاقتصاد الأميركي نفسه مشددين على أن ذلك قد يدفع الدول الأفريقية إلى البحث عن شركاء تجاريين بديلين وفي مقدمتهم الصين وتركيا والهند. وخلال السنوات الأخيرة أصبحت الصين أحد أكبر الشركاء التجاريين لأفريقيا بفضل الاستثمارات الضخمة في البنى التحتية وحزم القروض والاتفاقيات التجارية غير المشروطة. وبلغ حجم التبادل التجاري بين أفريقيا والصين عام 2024 نحو 296 مليار دولار منها 179 مليار دولار صادرات صينية إلى القارة في حين بلغ حجم التجارة بينهما منذ مطلع العام الجاري وحتى أغسطسآب الماضي 222 مليار دولار بزيادة 15 مقارنة بالفترة نفسها من العام السابق وفق بيانات للإدارة العامة للجمارك الصينية (حكومية).",

        "content": "تعد أفريقيا ثاني أكبر منطقة منتجة للذهب عالميا بعد الصين  وتسهم بنحو 27 من إجمالي الإنتاج العالمي ومع تزايد الطلب على الذهب كمخزن للقيمة ومكون أساسي في الصناعات التقنية تبرز مناجم القارة كركائز اقتصادية وإستراتيجية. يعد منجم نامديني الواقع في منطقة بولغاتانغا شمال شرق غانا من أبرز مشاريع تعدين الذهب الحديثة في غرب أفريقيا ويجسد تحولا اقتصاديا واستثماريا مهما للبلاد. يقع ضمن الحزام الجيولوجي المعروف ببيريميان غولد بيلت الذي يمتد عبر عدة دول أفريقية ويعد من أغنى المناطق بالذهب. المشروع مملوك لشركة \"كاردينال رسورسيز\" (Cardinal Resources) الأسترالية التي استحوذت عليها لاحقا شركة \"شاندونغ غولد\" (Shandong Gold) الصينية مما يعكس توسع الاستثمارات الآسيوية في قطاع التعدين الأفريقي وتشير التقديرات إلى أن المنجم يحتوي على احتياطات تفوق 5 ملايين أوقية من الذهب ويتوقع أن ينتج نحو 358 ألف أوقية سنويا باستخدام تقنيات تعدين مفتوحة السطح ومعالجة متقدمة. يوفر المشروع آلاف فرص العمل المباشرة وغير المباشرة ويسهم في تنمية منطقة مهمشة نسبيا كما ينتظر أن يدر عائدات ضريبية كبيرة للحكومة الغانية في المقابل تواجه الشركة مطالبات من منظمات محلية ودولية بضمانات بيئية صارمة لحماية الموارد الطبيعية وقد تعهدت بتطبيق معايير الاستدامة وفقا لمبادئ البنك الدولي . ويعزز منجم نامديني موقع غانا كمنافس إقليمي في سوق الذهب إلى جانب مالي وبوركينا فاسو ويعد مثالا واضحا لصعود الاستثمارات الأجنبية في قطاع المعادن الحيوية في أفريقيا. منجم أهافو ساوث في غانا من أبرز مناجم الذهب في غرب أفريقيا ويقع في منطقة بونو ويدار من قبل شركة \"نيومونت\" (Newmont) الأميركية. ينتج المنجم نحو 325 ألف أوقية من الذهب سنويا ويتميز بتقنيات تعدين ومعالجة متقدمة تساهم في رفع كفاءة الإنتاج وتقليل الأثر البيئي. يشكل المنجم ركيزة اقتصادية مهمة للمنطقة ويوفر فرص عمل واسعة ويسهم في دعم المجتمعات المحلية عبر برامج تنموية ومبادرات تعليمية وصحية. يعد المنجم جزءا من إستراتيجية غانا لتعزيز موقعها كمنتج رئيسي للذهب في القارة إلى جانب مشاريع أخرى في أهافو الشمالية ومنطقة أكيم. يواجه المنجم تحديات تتعلق بالاستدامة و الشفافية  والتزمت الشركة بتطبيق معايير صارمة في السلامة البيئية والمجتمعية وفقا للاتفاقيات الدولية مما يجعله نموذجا للتعدين المسؤول في أفريقيا. يعد منجم لولو غونكوتو في مالي من أكبر وأهم مناجم الذهب في غرب أفريقيا ويقع في إقليم كايس غربي البلاد وهو نتاج دمج بين منجمي \"لولو\" و\"غونكوتو\" ضمن مشروع موحد تديره شركة \"باريك غولد\" (Barrick Gold) الكندية إحدى كبرى شركات التعدين في العالم. ينتج المنجم أكثر من 300 ألف أوقية من الذهب سنويا ويسهم بشكل كبير في الاقتصاد المالي ويمثل نحو نصف صادرات البلاد من المعادن. يتميز المنجم ببنية تحتية متطورة تشمل منشآت معالجة حديثة ومرافق دعم لوجستي ويوظف آلاف العمال المحليين مما يجعله مصدرا رئيسيا للتنمية الاقتصادية والاجتماعية في المنطقة. يعد المنجم نموذجا للتعاون بين الحكومة المالية والشركات الدولية وتطبق فيه معايير صارمة للسلامة البيئية والمجتمعية ورغم التحديات الأمنية التي تواجهها مالي فإن المنجم يواصل العمل بفضل ترتيبات أمنية خاصة ودعم حكومي مباشر. وأعلنت \"باريك\" (Barrick) عن خطط لتوسيع عمليات الاستكشاف في المنطقة المحيطة مما يعزز من فرص زيادة الإنتاج في السنوات المقبلة. يمثل منجم لولو غونكوتو ركيزة إستراتيجية في خارطة الذهب الأفريقية ويعكس أهمية مالي كمركز إقليمي لإنتاج الذهب إلى جانب غانا وبوركينا فاسو في ظل الطلب العالمي المتزايد على هذا المعدن الثمين. منجم إساكان في بوركينا فاسو يعد من أبرز مشاريع تعدين الذهب في البلاد ويقع في المنطقة الشرقية بالقرب من الحدود مع النيجر . تديره شركة \"آي إيه إم غولد\" (IAMGOLD) الكندية وينتج نحو 250 ألف أوقية من الذهب سنويا مما يجعله من بين أكبر المناجم في غرب أفريقيا ويتميز المنجم باحتياطات كبيرة وبنية تحتية متطورة تشمل منشآت معالجة حديثة ومرافق دعم لوجستي وقد أسهم في تعزيز مكانة بوركينا فاسو كأحد أبرز منتجي الذهب في القارة. يوفر المشروع فرص عمل مباشرة وغير مباشرة لآلاف السكان المحليين ويسهم في دعم الاقتصاد الوطني من خلال الضرائب والإتاوات إلى جانب برامج المسؤولية الاجتماعية التي تشمل التعليم والصحة والمياه. ورغم التحديات الأمنية التي تواجهها البلاد خاصة في المناطق الحدودية فإن المنجم يواصل العمل بفضل ترتيبات أمنية مشددة وتعاون وثيق مع السلطات المحلية. كما تسعى الشركة إلى توسيع عمليات الاستكشاف في المناطق المجاورة مما يعزز من فرص زيادة الإنتاج في المستقبل. ويعد منجم إساكان نموذجا للتعدين المسؤول في بيئة معقدة ويعكس قدرة بوركينا فاسو على جذب الاستثمارات الأجنبية في قطاع المعادن رغم التحديات السياسية والأمنية ويسهم في تنويع الاقتصاد الوطني بعيدا عن الزراعة والمساعدات الخارجية. يعد منجم جيتا في تنزانيا من أكبر مناجم الذهب في شرق أفريقيا وأكثرها تطورا ويقع في منطقة موانزا شمالي غربي البلاد. تديره شركة \"أنغوغولد أشانتي\" (AngloGold Ashanti) وهي من أبرز شركات التعدين العالمية وينتج المنجم أكثر من 200 ألف أوقية من الذهب سنويا مما يجعله مساهما رئيسيا في صادرات تنزانيا المعدنية. يتميز منجم جيتا بتقنيات تعدين ومعالجة حديثة تشمل أنظمة ترشيح متقدمة ومراقبة بيئية دقيقة ويوظف آلاف العمال المحليين مما يعزز التنمية الاقتصادية والاجتماعية في المنطقة. يسهم المنجم في دعم المجتمعات المحيطة من خلال برامج مسؤولية اجتماعية تشمل التعليم والرعاية الصحية والبنية التحتية. حصل المنجم على إشادات دولية لالتزامه بمعايير السلامة والاستدامة ويعد نموذجا للتعدين المسؤول في أفريقيا وفي السنوات الأخيرة توسعت الشركة في عمليات الاستكشاف حول المنجم مما يعزز من فرص زيادة الإنتاج مستقبلا. يشكل منجم جيتا جزءا من إستراتيجية تنزانيا لتعزيز موقعها في سوق الذهب العالمي إلى جانب مناجم أخرى مثل نورث مارا وبوزواجي في ظل تزايد الطلب العالمي على الذهب كمخزن للقيمة ومكون أساسي في الصناعات التقنية. المنجم يعكس قدرة تنزانيا على جذب الاستثمارات الأجنبية وتحقيق التوازن بين النمو الاقتصادي والحفاظ على البيئة. ومنجم نورث مارا في تنزانيا يعد من أبرز مناجم الذهب في شرق أفريقيا ويقع في إقليم مارا شمالي غربي البلاد بالقرب من بحيرة فيكتوريا ويدار من قبل شركة \"باريك غولد\" الكندية وينتج نحو 180 ألف أوقية من الذهب سنويا مما يجعله مساهما مهما في صادرات تنزانيا المعدنية. يتميز المنجم ببنية تحتية متقدمة تشمل منشآت معالجة حديثة وتقنيات مراقبة بيئية ويوظف عددا كبيرا من العمال المحليين مما يسهم في تحسين الظروف الاقتصادية والاجتماعية في المنطقة. وواجه المنجم في السابق تحديات تتعلق بالنزاعات المجتمعية والبيئية إلا أن الشركة نفذت إصلاحات شاملة لتعزيز الشفافية وتطبيق معايير الاستدامة الدولية بما في ذلك برامج المسؤولية الاجتماعية التي تدعم التعليم والصحة والمياه. كما أطلقت \"باريك\" مبادرات للتنمية المحلية بالشراكة مع السلطات التنزانية مما عزز من الثقة المجتمعية في المشروع. ويعد نورث مارا جزءا من إستراتيجية تنزانيا لتوسيع إنتاج الذهب إلى جانب مناجم مثل جيتا وبوزواجي في ظل الطلب العالمي المتزايد على الذهب كمخزن للقيمة ومكون أساسي في الصناعات التقنية. منجم مبونينغ في جنوب أفريقيا من أعمق مناجم الذهب في العالم ويقع في منطقة ويست ويتس قرب مدينة كارلتونفيل على بعد نحو 90 كيلومترا جنوب غرب جوهانسبرغ. يدار المنجم من قبل شركة \"هارموني غولد\" (Harmony Gold) ويصل عمقه إلى أكثر من 3891 مترا تحت سطح الأرض مما يجعله أعمق منجم عامل على مستوى العالم. بدأ إنتاج المنجم في عام 1986 ويستخرج الذهب من طبقات جيولوجية غنية مثل \"فينترزدورب كونتاكت ريف\" (Ventersdorp Contact Reef) و\"كاربون ليدر ريف\" (Carbon Leader Reef) حيث تسجل درجات تركيز عالية تصل إلى أكثر من 14 غراما للطن. ينتج المنجم نحو 250 ألف أوقية سنويا ويسهم بنسبة كبيرة من إجمالي إنتاج الشركة وتعتمد عمليات المعالجة على تقنية \"الكربون في اللب\" لاستعادة الذهب وتجرى في منشآت متقدمة تابعة للمنجم. ورغم التحديات المرتبطة بالعمل في أعماق كبيرة مثل الحرارة والضغط فإن المنجم يواصل الإنتاج بفضل تقنيات السلامة المتقدمة وخطط التمديد التي تهدف إلى الوصول إلى احتياطات أعمق. يوفر المشروع فرص عمل واسعة ويسهم في دعم الاقتصاد المحلي كما يعد رمزا لتاريخ التعدين العريق في جنوب أفريقيا. ومع التوجه العالمي نحو الذهب كمخزن للقيمة يظل مبونينغ أحد أعمدة صناعة الذهب العالمية رغم التحديات التشغيلية والبيئية المرتبطة بعمقه الفائق. منجم دريفونتين أحد أقدم وأكبر مناجم الذهب في جنوب أفريقيا ويقع في منطقة غرب راند بمقاطعة غاوتينغ على بعد نحو 70 كيلومترا جنوب غرب جوهانسبرغ. تأسس المنجم في ثلاثينيات القرن الماضي ويعد جزءا من الحزام الذهبي الشهير الذي جعل جنوب أفريقيا في طليعة الدول المنتجة للذهب عالميا. يدار المنجم حاليا من قبل شركة \"سيباني ستيلووتر\" (Sibanye-Stillwater) التي استحوذت عليه ضمن صفقة شملت عدة أصول من شركة \"غولد فيلدز\" (Gold Fields). ينتج دريفونتين نحو 200 ألف أوقية من الذهب سنويا (6220 كيلوغراما تقريبا) رغم التحديات المرتبطة بتقادم البنية التحتية وارتفاع تكاليف التشغيل. يعتمد المنجم على التعدين العميق وتستخرج الخامات من أعماق تتجاوز 2500 متر مما يتطلب تقنيات متقدمة وإجراءات صارمة للسلامة. وشهد المنجم في السنوات الأخيرة عمليات إعادة هيكلة لتحسين الكفاءة وتقليل الانبعاثات البيئية إلى جانب مبادرات لدعم المجتمعات المحلية من خلال برامج التعليم والرعاية الصحية. ورغم تراجع إنتاج جنوب أفريقيا من الذهب مقارنة بعقود سابقة يظل منجم دريفونتين رمزا لتاريخ التعدين في البلاد ومصدرا مهما للعملة الصعبة وفرص العمل. كما يمثل تحديا مستمرا في كيفية الحفاظ على استدامة المناجم العميقة في ظل التغيرات الاقتصادية والبيئية العالمية. يعد منجم أرياب في السودان من أقدم وأهم مناجم الذهب في البلاد ويقع في منطقة أرياب بولاية البحر الأحمر داخل الصحراء النوبية وهي منطقة غنية بالمعادن وتاريخيا مرتبطة بالنشاط التعديني منذ العصور الفرعونية. يدار المنجم من قبل شركة أرياب للتعدين وهي شركة سودانية رائدة تأسست في ثمانينيات القرن الماضي وتملك الحكومة السودانية حصة الأغلبية فيها بينما كانت شركات فرنسية وكندية من بين الشركاء السابقين. ينتج المنجم الذهب من عدة مواقع مفتوحة أبرزها منجم \"هساي\" وقد بلغ إنتاجه التراكمي أكثر من 2.3 مليون أوقية منذ بدء التشغيل في عام 1992 مما يجعله المصدر التجاري الأول للذهب في السودان. يعتمد المنجم على تقنيات حديثة في الاستكشاف والمعالجة ويوظف أكثر من 1400 عامل معظمهم من السودانيين كما يسهم في دعم الاقتصاد المحلي من خلال توفير فرص العمل وتنفيذ مشاريع تنموية في المجتمعات المحيطة. وتخطط الشركة لتوسيع عملياتها لتشمل معادن أخرى مثل النحاس والزنك مستفيدة من البنية الجيولوجية الغنية للمنطقة. ورغم التحديات المرتبطة بالبنية التحتية والبيئة الصحراوية القاسية فإن منجم أرياب يظل ركيزة إستراتيجية في قطاع التعدين السوداني ومصدرا مهما للعملة الصعبة في ظل تقلبات الاقتصاد الوطني. منجم سيمافو في غينيا المعروف باسم منجم كينييرو يعد من المشاريع الذهبية البارزة في غرب أفريقيا رغم توقفه عن الإنتاج منذ عام 2014. كان المنجم يدار سابقا من قبل شركة \"سيمافو\" (SEMAFO) الكندية التي اندمجت لاحقا مع شركة \"إنديفور مينينغ\" (Endeavour Mining) ويقع في منطقة كانكان شرق البلاد. يعد سيمافو من أوائل المناجم الصناعية في غينيا وقد أسهم في تعزيز مكانة البلاد كمصدر واعد للذهب في القارة. بعد سنوات من التوقف أعلنت شركة \"روبيكس رسورسيز\" (Robex Resources) الكندية عن خطط لإعادة تشغيل المنجم بحلول عام 2025 بعد أن استحوذت عليه وبدأت في تطوير بنيته التحتية وتوسيع نطاق الاستكشاف خاصة في منطقة مانسونيا المجاورة. وتشير التقديرات إلى أن الموارد المستنتجة في المنجم قد زادت بنسبة 169 مما يعكس إمكانات واعدة للإنتاج المستقبلي ويتوقع أن يسهم المشروع في توفير فرص عمل جديدة وتنشيط الاقتصاد المحلي إلى جانب تعزيز صادرات الذهب الغينية. وتخطط الشركة لتطبيق معايير حديثة في السلامة والاستدامة البيئية بما يتماشى مع التوجهات العالمية في قطاع التعدين. يمثل منجم سيمافو نموذجا لتحول المناجم المتوقفة إلى أصول إستراتيجية ويعكس قدرة غينيا على جذب الاستثمارات الأجنبية في قطاع المعادن الحيوية.",

        "title": "أنا أقاوم إذن أنا موجود",
        "content": "حين يتأمل الساسة في الغرب الخريطة العربية والإسلامية كما يقول الدكتور سيف الدين عبد الفتاح أستاذ العلوم السياسية بجامعة القاهرة يدركون أنهم أمام \"قوة متحققة\" أو \"قوة ممكنة\" تستدعي القلق والحذر. تلك القوة الحضارية الكامنة هي ما يسعى المشروع الاستعماري إلى تفكيكه سياسيا وتخديره ثقافيا حتى يغدو الوجود العربي غافلا عن نفسه ذاهلا عن وعيه. من هذا الوعي المهدد ينطلق كتاب قاموس المقاومة ليعيد للعقل العربي قدرته على تسمية الأشياء بأسمائها واستعادة المعاني التي نهبت كما نهبت الأرض. الكتاب الصادر حديثا للدكتور سيف الدين عبد الفتاح أستاذ العلوم السياسية في جامعة القاهرة هو محاولة علمية جادة لتصنيف مفاهيم المقاومة ضمن منظومات فكرية ومعرفية متكاملة تربط بين المفهوم والفعل وتضع اللغة في صدارة معركة التحرر. فهو لا يكتفي ببلورة المفاهيم المحفزة للأمة بل يتناول أيضا تلك المفاهيم السامة التي تسللت إلى الوعي الجمعي لتصبح أدوات \"تسميم سياسي\" تسعى إلى شل إرادة الأمة وإعادة تشكيل وعيها وفق منظومات الهيمنة الحديثة. يقع هذا العمل في قلب المشروع الفكري الكبير للدكتور سيف الدين عبد الفتاح الذي يقوم على ثلاثة أعمدة: الفكر المقاصدي وفلسفة العمران الحضاري وفكر المقاومة والتحرير. عبر هذه الأعمدة بنى المؤلف منظومة معرفية تستحضر تراث الأمة وتجعل منه منطلقا للحاضر والمستقبل. فلطالما عرف ببحوثه العميقة في مقاصد الشريعة وتجديد النظر فيها ثم بقراءاته المعمقة في فكر العمران الخلدوني وقضايا النهوض الحضاري وبتفاعله الخلاق مع مفكرين كبار أمثال محمد عبده ومالك بن نبي وحامد ربيع وعبد الوهاب المسيري وطارق البشري. ويمثل قاموس المقاومة امتدادا نوعيا لمشروعه البحثي إذ يقدم الإطار المفهومي الذي تتساند عليه أعماله السابقة ويوسع من أفقها ليواكب المرحلة التاريخية الراهنة حيث تتقاطع المفاهيم بالمعارك وتتقدم اللغة إلى صدارة الاشتباك الحضاري. أما المؤلف فهو أحد أبرز المفكرين العرب في النظرية السياسية والفكر الحضاري شغل عددا من المناصب البحثية وأشرف على مشروعات علمية متنوعة من أبرزها \"موسوعة المصطلحات الإسلامية\" و\"موسوعة بناء المفاهيم الإسلامية\". وله ما يزيد على ستين كتابا أسسها جميعا ضمن مشروعه الفكري الإنساني الذي أسماه \"وقف القلم\" إيمانا منه بأن المعرفة فعل عبادة ومقاومة معا. يرى الأستاذ الدكتور عبد الفتاح أن المفاهيم ليست محايدة بل هي بنية من بنى الوعي وركيزة من ركائز الإدراك. فصناعة المفهوم صناعة للوعي ذاته والتلاعب بالمفاهيم سبيل لتزييف الوعي وإنتاج الاستلاب. وفي مقاربة تحليلية غنية يستند الكاتب إلى تجارب تحررية من العالم الثالث حيث اختار المناضل الأفريقي في جنوب أفريقيا ومسلمو الجزائر طريقهما المستقل في بناء مفاهيمهما وأطر وعيهما بعيدا عن معايير المستعمر الأبيض إدراكا منهم أن التحرر الفكري شرط للتحرر السياسي. في هذا الإطار يستحضر عبد الفتاح رؤية مصطفى صادق الرافعي الذي عد الكلمات كالحياض وكالجيوش يجب الدفاع عنها كما يدافع عن الأرض والعرض ورؤية البشير الإبراهيمي الذي دعا إلى \"رفع الظلم عن الكلمات المظلومة وكشف النقاب عن الكلمات الظالمة التي تغسل الأمخاخ وتستعير العقول\". فأول التطبيع يكون مع الكلمات الخبيثة حين ينتزع معناها من سياقها ويعاد توظيفها في خطاب الهيمنة. يستند الكتاب إلى تراث فكري واسع يستلهم أعلام المدرسة الحضارية الحديثة الذين نبهوا إلى قدرة المشروعات الاستعمارية على تحريف اللغة وكيف تسير العبارات الملطفة المقصودة جنبا إلى جنب مع الرغبة في السيطرة على السكان الأصليين والاستيلاء على الأراضي والموارد بداية من التوسع الأمريكي في براري الغرب وصولا إلى الاستعمار الأوروبي للأفارقة. ففي \"فقه المكان\" يحضر جمال حمدان الذي رأى في الجغرافيا الإستراتيجية سر الهوية والموقع وفي \"فقه الزمان\" يستعيد طارق البشري القدس باعتبارها وعاء للتاريخ لا مجرد مدينة في وطن وليست كبرلين التي يمكن استبدالها عند الألمان بعاصمة أخرى ولا حتى إسطنبول التي تبدلت عند الأتراك بأنقرة. كما يتوقف عند حامد ربيع فقيه التدبير والعقل الإستراتيجي الذي يدعو إلى دراسة العدو والتعمق في دراسات الحرب النفسية وعبد الوهاب المسيري مفكر الالتزام الحضاري الذي جعل من مقاومة المشروع الصهيوني فعلا معرفيا وأخلاقيا لتفكيك النموذج الاستعماري نفسه. والكاتب يتفحص الأشباه المتقاطعة والنظائر المشتركة بين هؤلاء المفكرين ويحاول أن يؤلف بين تلك الرؤى في إطار يسمح بتكافل المداخل وتعدد التخصصات وتأصيل المرجعيات. منذ الصفحات الأولى يضع الدكتور سيف الدين عبد الفتاح قارئه أمام حقيقة الصراع الكبرى محددا إياها بأنها حضارية وجودية ووظيفية في آن معا. فهي ليست نزاعا على أرض أو حدود بل معركة على الوعي والهوية لا يمكن فهمها إلا في ضوء معادلة رباعية تجمع بين المكان والزمان والتدبير والالتزام. بهذا المنظور يرسم الكتاب إطارا مرشدا لفهم اللحظة التاريخية التي نعيشها ويؤسس لوعي بالصراع بوصفه صراعا على الإرادة قبل أن يكون صراعا على الجغرافيا. من هذه العتبة الفكرية ينفتح النص على فصوله الثمانية كاشفا أن الانتفاضة الفلسطينية ليست واقعة مرحلية أو حلقة عابرة من مسار الكفاح الوطني بل ظاهرة أصيلة وضرورة حضارية ظهرت مع بدايات الاستيطان الصهيوني في أرض فلسطين. فالمقاومة قدر الأمة ما دام فيها حياة وما دام هناك مستعمر يسعى لطمس وجودها. تتصاعد المقاومة حينا وتخمد حينا آخر لكنها لا تنطفئ لأنها فعل دائم متجدد يعبر عن استمرارية الأمة وشمولية حركتها نحو التحرر. وتمثل الظاهرة الانتفاضية -بحسب الكتاب- من المنظور الحضاري إحدى حلقات الثورة على انحراف وجهة التعامل مع الصراع المفروض على المنطقة وهو صراع شامل بأبعاد عقدية وحضارية وتاريخية وجغرافية وهذه حقيقة يقدمها خطاب القوى اليمينية التي تقود الاحتلال. ومصيرية الصراع بحسب الكتاب لم تخفت وهي جلية واضحة في تصريحات السياسيين الإسرائيليين الذين لم يتخلوا عن حلم التهجير ومسح الخريطة من أهلها وقد آزرتهم في ذلك توجهات غربية. ويرى عبد الفتاح أن الانتفاضات هي موجات متصلة من الوعي الحضاري الثائر على اختلال معادلات القوة والتاريخ إذ تجاوزت هدفها السياسي المحدود لتصبح عملية إعادة تعريف شاملة لعلاقة الأمة بذاتها وبعالمها. فهي كما يقول لم تخلق لتعديل اتفاقيات أو تصحيح حدود بل لتصميم مسار جديد على المستويين العربي والإسلامي أعاد الفرد العربي والمسلم إلى دائرة الفعل بعد أن حوصر طويلا في موقع المتفرج. ومن هنا أحدثت الانتفاضة تحولا شعبيا تاريخيا في الوعي والموقف وأسهمت في إفشال مشاريع التطبيع وفي إحياء مركزية القضية الفلسطينية في الضمير الجمعي العالمي والإسلامي على حد سواء. وهذه المقاومة تطرح أربعة عناصر للمشروع الحضاري تتمثل في التمرد على الغرب الاستعماري والتحرر من التبعية والانكسار والهزيمة والبحث عن نموذج حضاري بديل يرتبط بالذاكرة الحضارية والوعي بالثقافة السائدة في الجماعة الوطنية والانخراط في إصلاحها لا الانسحاق أمامها. يعود المؤلف إلى اللغة باعتبارها جبهة من جبهات المقاومة فيقف عند الجذر العربي قوم الذي يشكل في نظره نبعا لغويا وروحيا يجمع بين \"القيام\" و\"الاستقامة\" و\"القيمة\" و\"القيومية\". فالمقاومة كما يبين فعل اشتقاقي يجمع بين الحركة والاستقامة والمدافعة ومنه تنبثق كل القيم القائمة على الفعل والموقف. يتجلى هنا المعنى القرآني العميق الذي يربط بين \"فاستقم كما أمرت\" و\"دين القيمة\" و\"الدين القيم\" حيث يقف المقاوم قائما على أمر أمته مقيما في موقع الشهود الحضاري. إن جذر \"قوم\" بحسب الكتاب يحرك كل قيمة وكل عمل قيم وقائم. وهنا تتجلى فوائد الاشتقاق في اللغة في أنه يمد لغتنا العربية بنهر من الألفاظ التي من خلالها نقوم بأخذ ألفاظ جديدة تعبر بعد ذلك عن معنى جديد مما يساعد على الاستحداث والتوليد في الألفاظ بالإضافة إلى أنه وسيلة من وسائل التنويع في الألفاظ للدلالة على المعاني المختلفة. ومن هذا الأصل اللغوي ينسج الكتاب شجرة مفاهيمية تربط المقاومة بجذرها الإيماني الأصيل وهو \"لا إله إلا الله\" التي يراها المؤلف ثورة على كل أشكال العبودية لغير الله وإعلانا دائما لتحرير الإنسان من الخضوع للمادة أو السلطة أو الزمن. فالتوحيد هو الطاقة الدافعة الروحية للمقاومة والجهاد هو التطبيق العملي لهذا التوحيد والمدافعة الحضارية هي صورته المستمرة في حياة الأمة لصون الأرض والعمران من الفساد والطغيان. فالمقاومة هي فعل \"دفع\" إيجابي يمنع خراب الأرض ويحميها. كما يربط الأستاذ الدكتور سيف الدين عبد الفتاح فعل المقاومة بالنداءات القرآنية التي تحث على الحركة والفعل مثل \"اقرأ\" \"أعدوا\" \"قل سيروا في الأرض فانظروا\". هذه النداءات تشكل طاقة دافعة ورافعة تحرك الأمة نحو النهوض ومقاومة كل طغيان أو عدوان ويشير إلى ما أكدت عليه الدكتورة منى أبو الفضل من أن الأمة يجب أن تكون \"أمة قطبا\" أي أمة محورية شاهدة على العالمين تتحقق فيها شروط \"الخيرية\" و\"الوسطية\". ويشير عبد الفتاح إلى أن المقاومة ليست دائما فعل مواجهة مسلحة بل قد تكون فعل امتناع تعبدي كما في المقاطعة التي يسميها \"العبادة الصامتة\" فهي في معناها الأخلاقي شبيهة بالصيام امتناع لله عن دعم الظالم وامتثال لبناء الوعي والكرامة. يتناول الكتاب أيضا مفهوم \"الغزو\" لا بوصفه غزوا عسكريا فحسب بل ظاهرة حضارية تتحرك بين العصور والمجالات. فالمستعمر كما يشرح عبد الفتاح متابعا فكر مالك بن نبي لا يكتفي بفرض سيطرته المادية بل يعمل عبر \"المعامل الاستعماري\" على خلق إنسان قابل للاستعمار يدافع عن القيود التي كبلته لأنه فقد القدرة على التفكير خارج أطرها. وهكذا تصبح \"القابلية للاستعمار\" مرضا حضاريا يصيب الوعي قبل الأرض كما قد تكون ناتجة عن صفات عقلية ونفسية ترسخت في أمة معينة نتيجة ظروف وصيرورة تاريخية معينة تجعلها تفشل في القيام بفعل المقاومة وبالتالي الشعور بالدونية اتجاه الآخر المتفوق حضاريا. ومن ثم فإن كلمة الغزو هنا بحسب الكتاب هي من \"المفاهيم الرحالة\" التي ترتحل من مجال إلى مجال ومن حضارة إلى حضارة ومن علم إلى علم وهو أمر جدير بالتنويه ويجب أن يكون موضع اهتمامنا حتى نشيد أركان تلك المقاومة الحضارية الشاملة لأن الصراع على المفهوم هو بداية الصراع على المصير. في فصل بالغ الأهمية يناقش المؤلف ظاهرة التصهين باعتبارها تجليا لأزمة الدولة القطرية العربية التي ولدت مشوشة من رحم التجزئة والتبعية. فقد انخرطت هذه الدول في \"شرق أوسط\" وظيفي مسكون بالتصهين بديل عن الفضاءين العربي والإسلامي اللذين ينتميان للوعي والضمير. ويعتبر عبد الفتاح أن إحلال مصطلح \"الشرق الأوسط\" محل \"العالمين العربي والإسلامي\" لم يكن إلا تمهيدا للقبول بالكيان الصهيوني داخل الفضاء الجغرافي والثقافي للأمة. يقرأ المؤلف طوفان الأقصى الذي انطلق في السابع من أكتوبرتشرين الأول 2023 بوصفه نقطة تحول كبرى أعادت فتح خطوط المواجهة بين جغرافيا المقاومة وجغرافيا التطبيع معلنا انتهاء مرحلة هندسة \"القبول\" بالكيان المحتل وبداية مرحلة استعادة الوعي الجماعي بالمواجهة الشاملة مع المشروع الصهيوني الغربي. وفي إطار شجرة المفاهيم ذاتها يقدم الدكتور سيف الدين عبد الفتاح معالجة دقيقة لمفهوم الحرب النفسية باعتبارها السلاح الأخطر في ترسانة الهيمنة الحديثة. فمع تطور أدوات السيطرة على النفس البشرية تحولت الحرب النفسية إلى بديل عن القتال المباشر. وبعبارة أخرى يرى الكتاب أن الحرب النفسية لا تسعى للإقناع وإنما تهدف إلى تحطيم الإرادة وتحطيم الثقة في الذات الجماعية أي فقدان المواطن ثقته بذاته في مواجهته لعدو يسعى للحصول على بعض التنازلات إن لم يتمكن من القضاء على المجتمع أو الكيان الذي ينتمي إليه الأفراد واحتوائه كليا بما يعنيه ذلك من فرض التبعية على ذلك الكيان. ينقل عبد الفتاح عن المفكر حامد ربيع قوله إن هذا اللون من الغزو هو \"القتال المعنوي\" الذي يسعى إلى تحطيم الإرادة قبل الجسد وإحداث انهيار في المناعة الثقافية للأمة. وقد جعل العدو الصهيوني من هذه الحرب محورا لإستراتيجيته منذ نشأته معتمدا على الدعاية والتدليس وتشويه المفاهيم. ومن هنا يلح الكتاب على ضرورة بناء \"وعي مضاد\" يواجه هذا الغزو بالمفاهيم الأصيلة ويحصن الذات والفكر من القابلية للتطبيع والتصهين. وما يؤكد على أهمية ذلك أن الاستهداف الإسرائيلي لم يعد يقتصر على دول الطوق بل امتد ليشمل دولا أخرى في محاولة لتطويق المقاومة وبات التصهين -وهو الأخطر- حالة يصبح فيها الفرد أو النظام \"يرى أن للمعتدي المحتل حقا في أرض فلسطين ويبرر عدوانه على الشعب الفلسطيني\" وهو ما يؤدي إلى ما يسميه عبد الفتاح \"قابليات التطبيع\" التي ظهرت في أشكال مكثفة من التعاون والتنسيق وصولا إلى توقيع العديد من الدول العربية للاتفاق المسمى \"وعد أبراهام\" وهو مشروع سياسي يهدف إلى تصفية القضية الفلسطينية وتمرير التطبيع وتغيير معالم المنطقة الثقافية والدينية لصالح المشروع الصهيوني. يفتح الدكتور سيف الدين عبد الفتاح ملف الجغرافيا السياسية بوصفها أحد المفاتيح الحاسمة لفهم التحولات الإستراتيجية في المنطقة. فهو يرى أن الجغرافيا في معناها الجيوإستراتيجي لم تعد علما محايدا بل أداة من أدوات إعادة الهيكلة السياسية والذهنية للعالم العربي. يتقاطع عبد الفتاح هنا مع الباحثة في الشأن الإسرائيلي هنيدة غانم التي رصدت في دراساتها كيف عززت إسرائيل مكانتها الإقليمية وسط تراجع أدوار الدول العربية التقليدية مشيرة إلى أن التطبيع مع إسرائيل تجاوز مفهوم \"السلام البارد\" ليغدو \"سلاما دافئا\" ينفذ ببطء إلى الوعي الشعبي فيتحول التطبيع من معاهدات سياسية إلى قبول ثقافي تلقائي. ويظهر عبد الفتاح أن مفهوم \"الشرق الأوسط\" لم يكن توصيفا بريئا لمساحة جغرافية بل أداة وظيفية أدخل عبرها الكيان الصهيوني إلى قلب المنطقة ليصبح جزءا من نسيجها السياسي والاقتصادي. هكذا يرى الكتاب أن مفهومي العالمين العربي والإسلامي يخرجان الكيان الصهيوني من حياضهما ولكن مفهوم الشرق الأوسط أحد المفاهيم الجغرافية القابلة لتسكين إسرائيل فيه ترتع في ساحاته ومساحاته كيف شاءت ورغم أن البعض يرى في الجغرافيا ودلالاتها أمرا محايدا فإن التعاطي معها على هذا النحو قد يحمل تحيزات خطيرة وعلى رأسها مفهوم الشرق الأوسط. ويستشهد الكاتب بكلمات بن غوريون الخطيرة التي تكشف البعد العملي لهذه الهيمنة: \"نحن شعب صغير لكن يمكننا معالجة هذه الثغرة بمعرفة نقاط ضعف أعدائنا العرب وخاصة العلاقات الهشة بين الأقليات والجماعات الطائفية\". هذه الكلمات كما يوضح عبد الفتاح مثلت نواة إستراتيجية إسرائيلية طويلة الأمد هدفها تفخيخ النسيج الاجتماعي العربي وتحويل التعدد القومي والديني إلى محركات للتفكك. ومنذ الخمسينيات شرعت إسرائيل في نسج شبكات تواصل وتحالف مع الأقليات في الدول العربية لا سيما تلك الأقطار المحاطة بدول غير عربية مثل العراق وسوريا والسودان لتعيد إنتاج المنطقة على أسس انقسامية وظيفية تخدم أمنها وتوسع نفوذها. لا يكتفي الكتاب بتحليل الواقع وتشخيص الاختلالات بل يتجاوزهما ليقترح رؤى حضارية قادرة على الفعل. فيقدم مفهومه المركزي: المقاومة الحضارية الشاملة باعتبارها الجهاز المناعي لجسد الأمة. وهي في نظر الكاتب عملية مستمرة منضبطة بالوحي تجمع بين الدفاع عن الإنسان وبناء العمران وتتحرك ضمن أفق فقهي وأخلاقي وحضاري يضبط أساليب المواجهة. وفي هذا الإطار يعدد الكتاب معارك من الممكن أن تشكل هذه المقاومة ومنها معركة التحرير من أجل التغيير (مواجهة العدوان والطغيان) ومعركة الذاكرة والهوية (لمواجهة الطمس الصهيوني) ومعركة المعنى والمغزى والمفاهيم (تحرير الكلمات المغتصبة والمسمومة) ومعركة الوعي الجمعي والإستراتيجي (صناعة الوعي والأمل) ومعركة الإرادة (إنهاء التطلعات الفلسطينية لتقرير المصير هو الهدف الصهيوني) والمعركة الحضارية الكونية (التضامن العالمي ورفض العنصرية الغربية). هذه المعارك كلها تنصهر داخل مشروع واحد تسنده منظومتان: الأمة القطب باعتبارها الأمة الوسط الشاهدة على العالمين والمقاومة القطب بوصفها القوة التنفيذية الموكلة بحراسة ضمير الأمة وكرامتها. في الفصل الأخير ينتقل الكتاب إلى الجانب العملي محددا أدوات المقاومة التي تمتلكها الأمة في واقعها الراهن. أولها المقاطعة التي يراها أوسع أنواع المقاومة لأنها امتناع شرعي وواع عن دعم الظالمين وهي عبادة صامتة تعيد للمسلم كرامة الفعل الإيماني المقاوم. ثم يقدم مبدأ فقه الفرصة أي اغتنام اللحظات التاريخية النادرة مثل طوفان الأقصى وتحويلها إلى مكاسب إستراتيجية دائمة. تليها أداة الاحتجاج والمظاهرات التي تصوغها الأمة بوصفها فعلا أخلاقيا إنسانيا ضد العدوان لا غضبا عابرا. وأخيرا العالم الكفاحي ودوره المقاوم ولذلك يميز سيف الدين عبد الفتاح بين علماء الطوفان الذين ينذرون علمهم في سبيل الجهاد والموقف الحر وعلماء السلطان الذين يبررون الطغيان ويخدرون الوعي. من خلال هذا التمييز يبرز مفهومه لـ\"التفسير الميداني للقرآن\" الذي مثله طوفان الأقصى عمليا حين التقت الآيات الجهادية والوعود القرآنية مع تفاصيل المعركة ليقدم مثالا حيا على تفعيل النص في الواقع. فالجهاد في هذا التفسير ليس عنفا متشددا بل هو بذل للجهد في سبيل التحرير والكرامة الإنسانية. هكذا لا يقدم قاموس المقاومة فكرا تحليليا فحسب بل مشروعا معرفيا لتجديد وعي الأمة بذاتها وبعالمها. فهو يحرر المصطلح من أسر الخصم ويعيد للغة سلطانها على الوعي ويصل بين التأصيل السنني والتفسير الميداني. لقد صاغ الدكتور سيف الدين عبد الفتاح في كتابه من \"طوفان الأقصى\" منارة فكرية تضيء للجيل القادم معالم الطريق وتفتح له طريق وعي يتجاوز رد الفعل وفعل يتجاوز الانفعال نحو مقاومة تبني كما تقاوم وتحيي كما تواجه.",

        "content": "تجري وزيرة المالية البريطانية راشيل ريفز اليوم الاثنين محادثات في العاصمة السعودية الرياض في مسعى للدفع قدما باتفاقية تجارية مع دول الخليج في الوقت الذي تسعى فيه إلى سد الفجوة المالية الهائلة في موازنة الشهر المقبل بإجراءات معززة للنمو وفق صحيفة فايننشال تايمز . وتسعى ريفز إلى إقناع الجهات المصدرة للتوقعات الرسمية بأن الاتفاقيات التجارية -بما في ذلك اتفاقية مع دول الخليج- إلى جانب إصلاحات التخطيط الجديدة التي يعجل البرلمان بإقرارها يمكن أن تعزز الاقتصاد وتقلل الحاجة إلى زيادات ضريبية مرهقة في 26 نوفمبرتشرين الثاني بمليارات الجنيهات الإسترلينية وفق الصحيفة البريطانية. وتعتزم ريفز أيضا عقد محادثات مع نظرائها من البحرين والكويت وقطر لإحراز تقدم فيما يتعلق باتفاقية تجارية مع مجلس التعاون الخليجي وفق رويترز. وقال وزير الدولة في وزارة الأعمال والتجارة البريطانية كريس براينت للبرلمان هذا الشهر إن المحادثات مع مجلس التعاون الخليجي وصلت إلى \"مرحلة متقدمة\" حسبما نقلت عنه الوكالة. تشير وزيرة المالية إلى ضرورة إدراج الاتفاقيات التجارية لا سيما تلك التي تم الاتفاق عليها مبدئيا مع الاتحاد الأوروبي في مايوأيار والاتفاقيات مع الهند والولايات المتحدة  ضمن توقعات النمو الصادرة عن مكتب مسؤولية الميزانية. يأمل المسؤولون الحكوميون أن يدرج مكتب مسؤولية الميزانية كذلك في توقعاته للميزانية مليارات الجنيهات الإسترلينية من الإيرادات الضريبية الإضافية التي يزعم أنها ستأتي من تخفيف بيروقراطية التخطيط كما يتم التخطيط كذلك لتطوير شبكات السكك الحديدية الشمالية. وبدأت بالفعل مفاوضات مع مكتب مسؤولية الميزانية وهو هيئة الرقابة المالية المستقلة حول مدى تأثير هذه السياسات على النمو وتقليص حجم العجز المالي المتوقع والذي يقدر بما يتراوح بين 20 و30 مليار جنيه إسترليني (26.68 مليار دولار و40 مليار دولار). وقالت ريفز التي تصطحب وفدا من قادة الأعمال البريطانيين إلى فعالية ( دافوس الصحراء) في الرياض: \"بعد صفقاتنا التاريخية مع الولايات المتحدة والاتحاد الأوروبي والهند نحن عازمون على البناء على هذا الزخم من خلال المضي قدما وتسريع وتيرة العمل\". ونقلت فايننشال تايمز عن مسؤولين بريطانيين قولهم إن ريفز ستستغل الرحلة لبناء زخم نحو اتفاقية تجارية مع مجلس التعاون الخليجي  بعد أن بدأت المحادثات معه عام 2022 في ظل حكومة المحافظين آنذاك. وقال مصدر للصحيفة إن ريفز أرادت إبرام الاتفاق في الوقت المناسب لإدراجه في توقعات الموازنة وأضاف آخر أنه سيكون \"مفاجئا\" إذا تمكنت من التوصل إلى اتفاق خلال رحلتها التي استمرت يومين. وأجلت ريفز ميزانيتها إلى 26 نوفمبرتشرين الثاني لمنح نفسها مزيدا من الوقت لإقناع مكتب مسؤولية الميزانية بأن لديها سياسات من شأنها تعزيز النمو وملء خزائن الحكومة وستكون المساومات حول التفاصيل متوترة وستشكل حزمتها المالية وفق الصحيفة. ويشير تحليل الحكومة البريطانية نفسها إلى أن اتفاقية التجارة مع دول مجلس التعاون الخليجي ستزيد الناتج المحلي الإجمالي البريطاني بمقدار 1.6 مليار جنيه إسترليني (2.13 مليار دولار) سنويا حيث تتطلع ريفز إلى تعزيز التجارة في مجالات تشمل الذكاء الاصطناعي وعلوم الحياة والخدمات المالية. في غضون ذلك أشارت الحكومة إلى أن اتفاقية \"إعادة ضبط\" الاتحاد الأوروبي ستضيف ما يقرب من 9 مليارات جنيه إسترليني (12 مليار دولار) إلى اقتصاد المملكة المتحدة بحلول عام 2040 بينما يتمثل الأمل الآخر في أن يقر مكتب مسؤولية الموازنة بسخاء إصلاحات التخطيط التي تهدف إلى تعزيز بناء المساكن ومشاريع البنية التحتية الكبرى. وحسب مكتب مسؤولية الميزانية في مارسآذار ستدر إصلاحات التخطيط السابقة ضرائب إضافية قدرها 3.4 مليارات جنيه إسترليني (4.5 مليارات دولار) بحلول عامي 2029 و2030 ويعتقد مسؤولو حزب العمال أن أحدث التغييرات في مشروع قانون التخطيط سيكون لها تأثير مماثل على المالية العامة. وقالت الحكومة \"وصلت المفاوضات بشأن اتفاقية تجارية مع مجلس التعاون الخليجي إلى مرحلة متقدمة وتتقدم بوتيرة متسارعة\" وتغطي المحادثات السلع والخدمات والاستثمار.",

        "content": "Российский экспорт в 2024 году в 20 крупнейших торговых партнеров вырос на 18, его общий объем достиг 330 млрд, несмотря на санкции западных стран. Об этом пишет Bild со ссылкой на данные Немецкого экономического института (Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft, IW). Евросоюз даже с учетом ограничений остается третьим по значимости торговым партнером России: общий товарооборот сторон составляет 67,5 млрд подсчитал IW. В то же время структура торговли существенно изменилась: Германия сократила импорт российских товаров на 92, однако общий объем товарооборота составил 9,5 млрд. Этот же показатель для Франции и Нидерландов составил 6 млрд для каждой. Торговля с Венгрией, напротив, выросла  импорт увеличился на 31, до 6,2 млрд. С Чехией, Словакией, Испанией, Бельгией и Италией объемы торговли заметно упали по сравнению с 2021 годом. Крупнейшим торговым партнером России по оценке IW оказался Китай: он стал в том числе главным импортером российских товаров (в первую очередь нефти, газа и угля) с объемом импорта в 130 млрд. Общий объем торговли между двумя странами в 2024 году составил порядка 244,8 млрд. Вторым по значимости покупателем российских товаров, в частности нефти, оказалась Индия, подсчитал институт. Издание также обратило внимание на торговлю России с Израилем: в 2024 году она существенно выросла, в том числе за счет импорта последним российской нефти, утверждают аналитики. Такие страны, как Армения, Узбекистан, Турция, Египет и Бразилия с 2022 года также значительно увеличили импорт российской продукции, говорится в докладе. По данным Федеральной таможенной службы, которые ведомство предоставляло в январе в ответ на запрос РБК, основными торговыми партнерами России в январеоктябре 2024 года были Китай (33,8 от товарооборота России) Индия (8,8) и Турция (8,3). Также в десятку вошли Белоруссия, Казахстан, Южная Корея, Германия, Армения, Италия и Узбекистан. Общий объем товарооборота России (импорт  экспорт) только за десять месяцев составлял 584 млрд. В досанкционном 2021 году пятерка крупнейших торговых партнеров России была такой: Китай (18,3), Германия (7,4), Нидерланды (5), Белоруссия (5), США (4,2). Турция находилась на шестом месте, Индия не входила в топ-10. Экспорт товаров из России за 2024 год составил 433,634 млрд, сообщал ЦБ, импорт  301,548 млрд. ФТС указывал, что экспорт составил 433,923 млрд, импорт  283 млрд. За первое полугодие 2025 года экспорт России составил 195,5 млрд в стоимостном выражении, при этом к тому же периоду 2024 года показатель снизился на 6, говорил в августе в интервью РБК глава Федеральной таможенной службы Валерий Пикалёв. Импорт вырос примерно на 1  до 131,6 млрд. В целом пятерка крупнейших торговых партнеров России по стоимостным показателям товарооборота по итогам первого полугодия выглядит так: Китай, Турция, Индия, Белоруссия, Казахстан. Серьезно расширяем поставки нужных нам товаров из таких стран, как Иран (плюс 10 по стоимости), Индонезия (плюс 48), Египет (43), Бразилия (10),  говорил он. Россия считает санкции западных стран незаконными и требует их отмены. Президент Владимир Путин подчеркивал , что ущерб от ограничительных мер несут государства ЕС.",

        "content": "Федеральная антимонопольная служба (ФАС) России выдала предупреждение Газпром нефть  Региональные продажи за ограничение отпуска топлива независимым АЗС на территории Новосибирской области в октябре, сообщило ведомство. По данным службы, этот федеральный поставщик занимает доминирующее положение на рынке бензинов АИ-92, АИ-95 и дизельного топлива в Новосибирской области. Региональное управление ФАС установило, что в октябре этого года компания увеличила объем продаж топлива вертикально интегрированным нефтяным компаниям. В то же время объем поставок независимым участникам сократился  в два раза по АИ-95, в четыре по АИ-92 и значительно по дизельному топливу. При этом общий объем продаж не изменился. Анализ ФАС не обнаружил причин, которые могли привести к ограничению продаж топлива независимым АЗС. Необходимо до 22 ноября прекратить создание дискриминационных условий на розничном рынке топлива. В случае неисполнения служба возбудит антимонопольное дело,  говорится в сообщении. РБК направил запрос в ООО Газпром нефть  Региональные продажи. В начале октября прокуратура Хабаровского края организовала проверку в связи с перебоями поставки топлива в трех районах региона. С конца сентября перебои с бензином наблюдаются в ряде регионов страны  в Крыму , в Приморье , на Курилах, в Запорожской и Курской областях . В России до конца сентября действовал запрет на экспорт бензина, для непроизводителей ограничения продлятся до конца октября. Их ввели на фоне роста биржевых цен на топливо и жалоб регионов на нехватку последнего. По словам вице-премьера Александра Новака, запрет будет продлен до конца года.",

        "title": "Германия отменила выпуск монет с волхвами и слоном из-за цен на серебро",
        "content": "Министерство финансов Германии отменило запланированный выпуск двух коллекционных монет номиналом 20 и 25 из серебра из-за подорожания этого металла, сообщает Financial Times со ссылкой на ведомство. В результате резкого подорожания серебра материальная стоимость немецких серебряных монет номиналом 20 и 25 евро в настоящее время значительно превышает их соответствующую номинальную стоимость,  говорится в сообщении министерства. На конец 2025-го был запланирован выпуск монет номиналом 25 с изображением трех волхвов из рождественского цикла, запущенного в 2021 году. Они изготовлены из 22 г чистого серебра, текущая рыночная стоимость монет составляет около 29. FT отмечает, что предыдущие экземпляры продавались по цене от 45,95. На январь 2026 года был запланирован выпуск монеты номиналом 20, посвященной 125-летию со дня открытия Вуппертальской монорельсовой дороги. На монете, изготовленной из 16,6 г чистого серебра, изображена слониха Туффи, которая в 1950 году выпрыгнула из вагона монорельса. Ее поездка была частью рекламной кампании передвижного цирка Франца Альтхоффа. Из-за большого скопления людей в вагоне Туффи наступила на ногу одному из журналистов, тот закричал, началась паника, передавшаяся слонихе. Она выбила окно вагона и упала в реку под подвесной дорогой, почти не пострадав. В Германии в этом году было выпущено десять памятных монет, в том числе четыре серебряных номиналом 20. Хотя немецкий Минфин планировал продавать монеты с наценкой, в сложившихся обстоятельствах выпуск новых монет такого рода невозможен, считают в ведомстве. Там добавили, что рассматривают возможность выпустить экземпляры в более поздние сроки, в том числе изучают вариант выпуска монет с скорректированными параметрами. Речь идет о снижении количества серебра, что эксперты называют порчей монет. На прошлой неделе цены на серебро установили новый исторический максимум, превысив 50 за унцию. Это произошло на фоне усиления напряженности в отношениях между США и Китаем, а также дефицита металла на лондонской бирже. На пике стоимость серебра составила 54,3 за тройскую унцию, затем цены начали падать . В настоящее время стоимость серебра на рынке составляет около 49,3 за унцию.",

        "content": "После антироссийских санкций США нефтеперерабатывающие заводы Индии перестали выходить на рынок российской нефти сорта Urals и перешли в режим ожидания, сообщает Bloomberg . Речь идет о таких компаниях, как Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. и Hindustan Petroleum Corp. По словам топ-менеджеров НПЗ, они выжидают указаний от правительства и оценивают возможные альтернативы. Кроме того, как пишет Bloomberg , до введения последних санкций цена на российскую нефть марки ESPO была выше более чем на 1 за баррель. По данным трейдеров, участвующих в торгах, спотовые продажи нефти этой марки, которая поставляется с Дальнего Востока России, предлагались со скидкой 50 за баррель по сравнению с эталонным сортом ICE Brent. Цена на российскую нефть упала после того, как западные санкции вынудили китайские нефтеперерабатывающие компании отменить некоторые закупки, уточнило агентство. США ввели санкции в отношении Роснефти, ЛУКОЙЛа и их дочерних компаний 22 октября. Американский Минфин объяснил эти действия отсутствием у России серьезной заинтересованности в мирном процессе и призвал союзников присоединиться. Трамп в начале августа повысил до 50 пошлины для Индии из-за того, что правительство Индии в настоящее время прямо или косвенно импортирует нефть из России. В середине октября президент США утверждал, что индийский премьер Нарендра Моди пообещал, что Индия больше не будет покупать российскую нефть. Москва считает вводимые санкции незаконными. В Кремле также заявляли, что требования США по прекращению торговых отношений с Россией, в том числе по поставкам энергоносителей, являются незаконными угрозами.",

        "content": "Экономика России в начале 2026 года выйдет из состояния перегрева, заявила глава Банка России Эльвира Набиуллина на пресс-конференции по итогам заседания совета директоров ЦБ. Ее слова приводит корреспондент РБК. Экономика, по нашим оценкам, в первом полугодии следующего года выйдет из состояния перегрева,  сказала она, добавив, что Банк России с учетом ее фактической динамики снизил прогноз по росту ВВП на этот год до 0,51. 24 октября совет директоров Банка России принял решение снизить ставку на 50 б.п., до 16,50 . Кроме того, ЦБ ухудшил прогноз инфляции. По актуальным данным, в 2026-м годовая инфляция должна снизиться до 4,05,0, хотя ранее регулятор прогнозировал прирост цен не более 4. В феврале министр экономического развития Максим Решетников заявил, что экономика России с конца 2024 года вошла в период замедления темпов роста. Сейчас проявляются первые признаки охлаждения в экономике . Уже по итогам ноября и декабря мы видим, что рост перестал быть фронтальным,  отметил он. Премьер-министр Михаил Мишустин подчеркивал, что темпы роста экономики нужно наращивать , но нельзя, чтобы они были высокими постоянно. Он добавил, что темпы роста российской экономики в шесть раз превышают показатели европейской экономики. В 2024-м эксперты и чиновники не раз заявляли о перегреве российской экономики. Это состояние характеризуется тем, что спрос опережает возможности предложения, а уровень ВВП находится выше потенциала. Набиуллина говорила, что это первый случай циклического перегрева экономики за десять лет и требуется длительный период сохранения высоких ставок для охлаждения спроса. В марте того же года она отмечала, что пик этого состояния экономики пройден .",

        "title": "Генпрокуратура потребовала изъять имущество членов челябинской ОПГ",
        "content": "Генпрокуратура потребовала признать экстремистским объединением и запретить челябинскую группировку, которую она называет Махонинские, а также обратить в доход государства имущество ее членов, их близких и подконтрольных ей фирм, сообщает Коммерсантъ со ссылкой на поданный надзорным ведомством административный иск в Советский районный суд Челябинска. РБК обратился за комментарием в Советский районный суд Челябинска. Ответчиками значатся 16 физических лиц, в том числе братья Александр и Андрей Махонины, их родственники и знакомые, а также семь фирм. Пять человек и семь компаний указаны в качестве заинтересованных лиц. Как пишет Ъ, в иске говорится, что прокуратура совместно с региональным управлением ФСБ выявила объединение Махонинские, действовавшее с 1990-х годов, участники которой привержены идеям движения Арестантское уголовное единство (АУЕ, признано экстремистским и запрещено в России). По данным ведомства, его создали и возглавляют братья Андрей и Александр Махонины, оба судимые. Так, Александр Махонин был осужден за покушение на убийство в 1990-м, а Андрей Махонин  за хулиганство, сопряженное с причинением телесных повреждений местному жителю в 1983-м, за незаконную торговлю подакцизными товарами в 1985-м и за самоуправство в 1999 году. Еще один ответчик, Максим Попов, которого Генпрокуратура называет телохранителем лидеров объединения, в 1993 году был осужден за разбойное нападение. Как сказано в иске, участниками группы являются родственники и близкие Махониных и Попова, в том числе Михаил Игнатов, сын бывшего начальника управления по борьбе с организованной преступностью при УВД Челябинской области, который состоит в отношениях с дочерью Александра Махонина Ольгой и является держателем части активов данного объединения. По данным надзорного ведомства, Махонинские с момента создания занимались вымогательствами, грабежами, разбоями, силовым переделом экономических сфер влияния, запугиванием жителей Челябинской области, своих конкурентов и оппонентов. В частности, в 1999 году, сообщает Генпрокуратура, группировка осуществила захват колхозного рынка в Челябинске, в результате которого доли перешли Махониным. Таким же способом они обратили в собственность развлекательный центр, первоначально называвшийся Монте-Карло, указывают в прокуратуре. Там отметили, что в 2008 году совладелец этого объекта отказался передать представителям объединения 20 здания и был забит до смерти, после чего его наследники были вынуждены передать долю по заниженной цене. В настоящее время права на центр принадлежат братьям Махониным, их родственнику, Попову другим. Кроме того, по данным Генпрокуратуры и регионального управления ФСБ, Махонинские были причастны к погрому на рок-фестивале Торнадо в 2010 году, который проводили на территории детского лагеря. Тогда около сотни человек, вооруженных арматурой и травматическими пистолетами, напали на зрителей и избили их. Потерпевшими тогда признали 39 человек. Основной причиной нападения называли неприязнь атаковавших к увлечению зрителей. Организатором атаки следствие сочло Роберта Назаряна  он получил шесть лет лишения свободы. Еще 12 фигурантов получили сроки от трех до пяти лет. Как пишет Коммерсантъ, Максим Попов и еще один ответчик по иску Генпрокуратуры Александр Гирь были осуждены за участие в драке по делу о массовых беспорядках и экстремизме. Позже они были включены в реестр экстремистов и террористов Росфинмониторинга. По данным Генпрокуратуры, братьев Махониных тогда не привлекли к ответственности из-за неформальных отношений с властями и правоохранительными органами. Об этом свидетельствует контакты объединения с бывшими губернатором Челябинской области Юревичем М.В. и заместителем председателя Законодательного собрания Челябинской области Струковым К.И.,  говорится в иске. В июле суд конфисковал доли Константина Струкова в Южуралзолоте, а также другие активы его и его окружения в доход государства. Через несколько дней Советский районный суд Челябинска отстранил его от должности президента управляющей компании ЮГК. На этой неделе Генпрокуратура подала новый иск с требованием об изъятии в доход государства принадлежащего Струкову и его дочерям имущества на сумму 1,4 млрд руб., а также денежных средств в размере 3,5 млрд руб., которые, как считает ведомство, были добыты коррупционным путем. По данным правоохранительных органов, возглавляемое братьями Махониными объединение имеет связи с лидерами преступных групп, контролирует часть доходов, формируемых в местах лишения свободы с использованием информационно-телекоммуникационных технологий, в том числе в виде фишинга, фарминга, двойной трансакции. Эти средства в том числе вкладываются в ликвидные активы. По информации Генпрокуратуры, Махонинские через подконтрольные фирмы и доверенных лиц, которые являются соответчиками по иску, владеют большинством точек розничной торговли в Челябинске и другими активами общей стоимостью не менее 2,5 млрд руб. Также, по сведениям надзорного ведомства, им принадлежат 109 объектов недвижимости и 12 транспортных средств, в том числе маломерные суда. В иске отмечается, что, как установил Росфинмониторинг, доходы от коммерческого использования этого имущества выводятся за рубеж.",

        "content": "Запад стремится поделить Россию на десятки мелких государственных образований, чтобы эксплуатировать в своих интересах. Такое мнение высказал секретарь Совета безопасности России Сергей Шойгу в статье для Аргументов и фактов. По словам Шойгу, сегодня на Россию и ее общество оказывается агрессивное давление извне. Против нас развернута мощнейшая антироссийская пропаганда. Атаки на нашу историю, культуру, духовные ценности не прекращаются, так же как и попытки вбить клин в согласие, братство народов нашей страны и стран СНГ,  пишет он. Недружественные России правительства ошибочно полагают, что многонациональность страны  это ее уязвимое место, и с завидным упрямством предпринимают попытки разобщить российское общество, отмечает Шойгу. Их цель  десуверенизация нашей страны. Они хотят поделить нашу Родину на десятки мелких государственных образований, чтобы затем подчинить своей воле, эксплуатировать, использовать в своих корыстных интересах,  написал он. По мнению Шойгу, Запад не понимает природы российских межнациональных отношений, духовной, нравственной силы, единства многонационального народа России, позволяющего уверенно противостоять разрушительным геополитическим технологиям. Ключевой задачей России на сегодняшний день является укрепление межнационального мира внутри страны, считает Шойгу. В современном мире Россия является образцом национальной политики, а ее модель межнациональных отношений  пример для других государств, добавил он. Попытки расколоть российское общество, используя сепаратизм, национализм и подобные им идеологии, участились, и ФСБ должна активнее противостоять всей этой мрази, говорил президент Владимир Путин в 2023 году. По его словам, такая стратегия всегда применялась в отношении России. США и их союзники ставят перед собой цель нанести России стратегическое поражение и если не уничтожить ее, то свести ее до ничтожной роли, отмечал Путин. Геополитические недоброжелатели уже пытались доразвалить Россию после распада СССР, желая взять реванш за неудачи в борьбе с Россией в разные периоды истории, говорил он. Недоброжелатели стремятся в условиях быстро изменяющегося мира сохранить свою гегемонию, в том числе и за счет России, ее огромных территорий, людских и природных ресурсов, пояснял глава государства. Сделать это в том числе за счет России после ее возможного дробления. Видимо, кто-то посчитал нашу страну слабым звеном,  заявил в 2024 году Путин. Он подчеркнул, что сторонники этого мнения ошибаются. Никому не удастся это сделать,  сказал глава государства.",

        "content": "Содержание: Кто может зарегистрироваться в качестве ИП Как самостоятельно открыть ИП Физические лица регистрируют ИП для ведения коммерческой деятельности. В 2025 году правом открыть ИП обладают жители России как с временной, так и с постоянной пропиской, за исключением военных, госслужащих и правоохранителей. К несовершеннолетним кандидатам предъявляются дополнительные требования: с 14 лет необходимо согласие родителей, а с 16  подтверждение дееспособности от органов опеки или судебных инстанций. У всех претендентов не должно быть заболеваний, которые могут повлиять на выполнение их прав и обязанностей. Для ряда направлений деятельности предусмотрено требование об отсутствии судимости. Одновременно можно иметь один статус ИП, но при этом выступать учредителем других организаций. Инструкция о том, как открыть ИП в 2025 году, содержит 11 шагов. Самостоятельно открыть ИП возможно по месту как постоянного, так и временного проживания. Это позволит вести бизнес на всей территории страны. Существует четыре способа подачи соответствующей заявки. Будущий предприниматель имеет возможность открыть ИП онлайн как на сайте ФНС , так и через Госуслуги . В этих целях предусмотрены специальные сервисы, среди которых РБиДОС и  Контур . Документы потребуется заверить квалифицированной электронной подписью (КЭП). Госпошлина отсутствует, срок обработки запроса  три дня. На этапе подготовки необходимо определиться, какой бизнес планируется вести. Каждому из них соответствует определенный код в Общероссийском классификаторе видов экономической деятельности (ОКВЭД) . ИП недоступны сферы, которые связаны с производством лекарств, страхованием, кредитованием и другие. Классификатор содержит разделы по видам деятельности, именуемые латинскими буквами от A до U. Они не участвуют в формировании кодов. Последние состоят из шести цифр, где первые две обозначают класс, три  подкласс, четыре  группу, пять  подгруппу, шесть  вид. Чем больше цифр, тем уже направление бизнеса. Их минимальное количество в заявлении  четыре. Ограничений по количеству выбранных ОКВЭДов нет, позднее этот список можно актуализировать. Стоит обратить внимание на основной код, который будет означать деятельность с большей частью ожидаемого дохода. От него также зависит размер страховых выплат за персонал  он будет больше у бизнеса с высокими рисками. Социальная деятельность и работа с детьми дополнительно потребуют справку об отсутствии судимости. Ее подготовка может занять до 30 дней. Ряд кодов ОКВЭД подразумевает оформление разрешения или лицензии, их отсутствие грозит конфискацией продукции или штрафом. Для регистрации ИП необходимо подготовить : Чтобы открыть ИП, нужно написать бумажное или электронное заявление. Требование к первой форме  заполнение печатными буквами и использование чернил черного, фиолетового или синего цвета, ко второй  шрифт Courier New размером 18 пунктов. Документ содержит пять листов. На первом указываются личные данные (Ф.И.О., ИНН, пол, гражданство, дата и место рождения). Вторая страница будет содержать данные паспорта и адрес. На третьей необходимо оставить сведения о документах, подтверждающих право на пребывание в стране, а также электронную почту. Четвертая страница предусмотрена для выбранных ОКВЭДов. На пятой потребуется указать методы предоставления и получения документов и контактный номер. Также она содержит отдельный блок данных лица (инспектора или нотариуса), подтвердившего подлинность подписи заявителя. Электронные документы заверяются КЭП. Выбор отделения ФНС зависит от места регистрации будущего предпринимателя. Обычно инспекции распределены по всем регионам России и городским районам. Полный список адресов и контактов действующих учреждений доступен на официальном портале ФНС. Для личной подачи документов предусмотрена возможность предварительной записи на прием. Чтобы зарегистрировать ИП онлайн, нужно создать личный кабинет на сайте ФНС, заполнить электронное заявление и прикрепить копии документов, заверенные КЭП. Рассмотрение заявки занимает три дня. В случае положительного решения ФНС направляет заявителю бумажное или электронное уведомление о регистрации в Едином государственном реестре индивидуальных предпринимателей (ЕГРИП). Выбор способа получения осуществляется на этапе оформления заявки. Информация об открытии ИП автоматически поступает в Росстат, СФР и ФОМС. Отказ может быть вызван такими причинами, как недееспособность, банкротство, наличие уже открытого ИП или ошибки в документах. Физическое лицо имеет право повторно подать заявку. В 2025 году ИП имеет выбор среди шести систем налогообложения. Налог на профессиональный доход (НПД) . Условиями, как открыть ИП на НПД, являются самостоятельное оказание услуг предпринимателем, отсутствие сотрудников, доход до 2,4 млн руб. Ставка составляет 6. ИП на НПД освобождаются от использования кассовой техники. Законодательство разрешает ИП работать с наличными до 100 тыс. руб. за один договор. Но при этом предпринимателю будут недоступны гранты, тендеры, госзакупки, кредитование, лизинг, эквайринг и международный рынок. Открыть расчетный счет потребуется, если клиенты и контрагенты осуществляют безналичные транзакции. Банки самостоятельно уведомляют о том, что ИП открыл расчетный счет, как ФНС, так и внебюджетные фонды. Кассовая техника потребуется почти каждому бизнесмену. Исключения закреплены в законодательстве. Выбор кассовой техники зависит от специфики бизнеса, объема продаж, необходимости мобильности и интеграции с другими системами учета. После покупки необходимо заключить договор с оператором фискальных данных (ОФД), лично или удаленно зарегистрировать кассу в налоговой и подключить ее к ОФД. Перед тем как зарегистрировать ИП, важно учесть виды деятельности, которые требуют обязательного лицензирования. Среди них: Все подобные виды работ перечислены в соответствующем законодательстве. Лицензии выдает уполномоченный госорган, который определяется в зависимости от выбранной сферы бизнеса. Для этого нужно отправить туда документы, оплатить госпошлину, а после положительного результата соблюдать условия, указанные в лицензии. Некоторые виды бизнеса предусматривают разрешение от местных органов власти или государственных организаций. Например, разрешение на установку рекламных конструкций, санитарно-эпидемиологическое заключение для предприятий общественного питания и торговли продуктами, разрешение на использование земельных участков или помещений. Индивидуальные предприниматели становятся работодателями спустя три дня после сдачи отчета ЕФС-1 в СФР. Этот документ содержит информацию о занятых сотрудниках и страховых взносах. Речь идет о трудоустройстве по трудовому или гражданско-правовому договорам. В первом случае срок отправки ЕФС-1  один день после подписания, во втором  30 дней. Предоставление отчета возможно в бумажной (штат до десяти человек включительно) и электронной (при наличии более десяти сотрудников) формах. Предприниматель получит обратную связь о регистрации по почте.",

        "content": "Американская корпорация Amazon планирует сократить до 30 тыс. рабочих мест в своих компаниях в попытках уменьшить расходы и издержки от избыточного найма на фоне спроса в период пандемии. Об этом сообщает Reuters со ссылкой на три источника, знакомых с ситуацией. По их информации, сокращения начнутся с 28 октября. Тем не менее 30 тыс. сотрудников  не так уж и много, учитывая, что всего в Amazon работает 1,55 млн человек, пишет Reuters . Де-факто речь идет менее чем об 1 от общего штата компании. Вместе с тем это почти 10 из 350 тыс. корпоративных сотрудников Amazon, что делает сокращение рабочих мест крупнейшим с конца 2022 года (27 тыс. позиций). Уведомления о сокращениях сотрудникам будут рассылать по электронной почте. В течение последних двух лет Amazon проводила сокращения во многих подразделениях, но не столь масштабные, отмечает Reuters . Новая волна может затронуть такие отделы, как кадров, операций, устройств и сервисов, а также Amazon Web Services, сообщили источники. По информации собеседников агентства, руководителям затронутых команд 27 октября предложили пройти обучение по общению с персоналом. Это произошло за день до начала предполагаемой волны сокращений. Генеральный директор Amazon Энди Джасси стремится к сокращению числа менеджеров, пишет Rеuters. В рамках этого плана в 2025 году он создал анонимную линию для сбора жалоб на неэффективность работы корпорации: туда поступило уже 1,5 тыс. обращений. Линия помогла внести порядка 450 изменений во внутренние процессы, говорил Джасси. В июне гендиректор заявил, что более широкое использование инструментов с искусственным интеллектом, вероятно, приведет к дальнейшему сокращению рабочих мест, в том числе вследствие автоматизации рутинных и циклических задач.",

        "content": "Несмотря на включение в 19-й пакет санкций Евросоюза против России будущего запрета на импорт российского сжиженного природного газа (СПГ), ЕС остается крупнейшим покупателем этого топлива, следует из данных Центра исследований энергетики и чистого воздуха (Crea), которые приводит The Guardian. В объявленный на этой неделе пакет санкций ЕС вошел запрет на импорт российского СПГ по краткосрочным контрактам с 25 апреля 2026 года, по долгосрочным  с 1 января 2027 года. По информации Crea, в Евросоюз идет половина всего российского экспорта СПГ, за ним следуют Китай (22) и Япония (18). Согласно данным, которые приводит Guardian в инфографике на основе сведений Crea, Kpler, Евростата и ENTSOG, с начала военной операции на Украине и к концу сентября 2025-го ЕС закупил российского СПГ на сумму 42 млрд. Также ЕС остается крупнейшим покупателем российского трубопроводного газа (35), обгоняя Китай (30) и Турцию (29). В октябре Bild со ссылкой на данные Немецкого экономического института (Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft, IW) сообщил, что Евросоюз даже с учетом ограничений остается третьим по значимости торговым партнером России: общий товарооборот сторон составляет 67,5 млрд . Крупнейшим торговым партнером России, по оценке IW, оказался Китай с объемом импорта 130 млрд, Вторым по значимости покупателем российских товаров, в частности нефти, оказалась Индия. Россия считает санкции западных стран незаконными и требует их отмены. Президент Владимир Путин подчеркивал, что ущерб от ограничительных мер несут государства ЕС.",

        "title": "Brussels and Washington strike again. Will Russia bend?",
        "content": "The European Union and the United States have once again announced new sanctions against Russia. This time almost simultaneously. Brussels has finally approved its long-discussed 19th sanctions package. Although Slovakia and Hungary initially opposed it, their objections were overcome. Yet, despite the political fanfare, the new measures are unlikely to deliver a serious blow to the Russian economy. Moscow anticipated them well in advance. As usual, the EU has expanded its list of sanctioned individuals and companies. The inclusion of industrial enterprises in these lists has become routine, and their effect increasingly symbolic. More interesting are the secondary sanctions targeting Chinese companies involved in buying and processing Russian oil. Brussels hopes to deter Chinese businesses from handling Russian commodities. Whether that works is doubtful. Oil imports from Russia are profitable for China, and any external interference is likely to provoke irritation and possible retaliation from Beijing. The EU has also extended restrictions on Russian banks. But since the sector is already under heavy US sanctions, the additional European measures will change little. The list of sanctioned oil tankers has grown, though this too seems more cosmetic than consequential because Russias so-called shadow fleet continues to operate effectively, avoiding Western oversight. In another familiar move, the EU is targeting financial institutions in third countries that maintain ties with Russia, especially those using the Russian equivalents of Western payment systems  the Financial Messaging System (SPFS), Mir, and the Faster Payments System (FPS). Export controls are being tightened, but the additions to the already massive Regulation 8332014 are modest compared to the sweeping bans introduced in 20222023. Other measures appear more symbolic than strategic. Brussels has banned the provision of services to Russias tourism sector and introduced new restrictions on the movement of Russian diplomats  steps that recall the old Cold War playbook. The prohibition on importing Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) may sound significant, but it simply formalizes a process already under way as European buyers quietly reduced purchases months ago. Across the Atlantic, Washingtons new sanctions appear more focused, but not necessarily more effective. President Donald Trumps administration has imposed blocking sanctions on two major Russian energy companies and their subsidiaries. Given that the energy sector is already constrained by wide-ranging export controls, this changes little in substance. Yet the decision is politically symbolic. It represents the first major sanctions move by Washington since Trump returned to the White House, a signal that US domestic hawks have regained influence. The reintroduction of sanctions marks a negative indicator  a sign that prospects for resolving the Ukraine crisis are receding. Officially, Washington claims these steps are designed to encourage a ceasefire. In reality, they reflect a deepening stalemate. Russia has made clear that a ceasefire alone will not solve anything; it would merely freeze the conflict without addressing its root causes. Any durable solution must be comprehensive and reflect Moscows long-stated security demands. Instead, the new sanctions suggest the conflict is entering a new phase, one of intensified pressure and prolonged confrontation. Both sides are now maneuvering for advantage ahead of future negotiations that may come sooner or later. For now, the hawks in the Western camp appear to have succeeded in steering US policy back toward escalation. But the likely result will not be strategic gain for the West  only further damage to Ukraine, which continues to pay the price for the ambitions of others.

        "content": "Vladimir Zelensky expects Ukraine to be able to fight Russia for up to three more years, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has told the Sunday Times. The Ukrainian leaders reported remark comes as the EU looks for new ways to fund Kiev, eyeing Russias frozen central bank assets as an option. In an interview with the British newspaper on Saturday, Tusk quoted Zelensky as saying that he hopes that the war will not last ten years, but that Ukraine is ready to fight for another two, three years. Should the conflict with Russia drag on longer, Zelensky is anxious about the toll the war would take on its population and economy, the Polish prime minister said. On Tuesday, the Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that Ukraine has serious financial problems. The outlet wrote, citing anonymous EU sources, that Kiev only has enough money to stay afloat until the end of the first quarter of 2026. On Wednesday, the Ukrainian parliament passed a draft budget for 2026, which runs a deficit of over 58. In recent weeks, EU leaders have intensified discussions over a so-called reparations loan of up to 140 billion (163 billion) for which the frozen Russian assets would serve as collateral. Under the scheme, Ukraine would be required to repay the loan only if Moscow compensates it for damages inflicted during the conflict. The bloc has already tapped into the revenues generated by the immobilized Russian assets. Moscow has described this as theft and has vowed to retaliate. Following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, the US and EU blocked an estimated 300 billion in Russian assets  around 200 billion (213 billion) of which is being held by the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear. Belgium has repeatedly objected to the proposed plan, demanding that the risk be shared among all EU members in case the scheme backfires. On Thursday, Prime Minister Bart De Wever told reporters that his countrys concerns have not been adequately addressed.",

        "content": "Former US Vice President Kamala Harris indicated she may make another bid for the presidency despite her 2024 election defeat to Donald Trump. In an interview with the BBC on Saturday, Harris, 61, said she is certain the world will see a woman in charge in the White House in their lifetime. Asked whether she could be the one, she replied: Possibly, adding that she has not made a decision on whether to run in 2028. I am not done. I have lived my entire career a life of service, and its in my bones. And there are many ways to serve. I have not decided yet what I will do in the future beyond what Im doing right now. Harris was also pressed on her political odds in the White House race after bookmakers placed her behind celebrity figures such as actor and former pro wrestler Dwayne The Rock Johnson. Harris remained unfazed, saying, Ive never listened to polls. If I listened to polls, I would not have run for my first office or my second office, and I certainly wouldnt be sitting here in this interview. Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024 after Joe Biden dropped out of the race following a disastrous debate with Trump, during which he appeared to stumble over his words and lose his train of thought, prompting concerns about his age and fitness for office. Harris went on to face Trump, who soundly defeated her in the November election. With the next presidential race three years away, media outlets have speculated that possible Democratic contenders in the 2028 election could include Harris, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Among the Republicans, Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are widely regarded as the most likely key contenders. Trump himself has hinted he might seek a third term, although the Constitution bars any president from being elected more than twice.",

        "content": "The majority of Americans hold a negative view of US President Donald Trumps use of AI-generated videos to mock his opponents, a new YouGov poll has suggested. The survey conducted last week found that 61 of respondents strongly disapproved and another 9 somewhat disapproved of a video in which Trump appeared piloting a fighter jet and dropping feces on a portrayal of a recent No Kings anti-government protest in New York City. Sixty percent of poll respondents called the video unpresidential, while more than half described it as disturbing or offensive. Only a small share viewed it positively, with 15 finding it entertaining and just 9 saying it was clever. Not all reactions were critical, however. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the video, saying Trump was likely the most effective political figure ever to use social media and that his posts were meant as satire, not calls for violence. The No Kings protest was part of a broader wave of demonstrations earlier this month. Organizers claimed more than 2,700 events took place across all 50 states. Protesters accused Trump of abusing his power and undermining democracy, while his supporters dismissed the events as partisan efforts to discredit his administration. Respondents also expressed strong disapproval of two other AI-generated videos shared by Trump, one showing former President Barack Obama being arrested in the Oval Office, and another reimagining the Gaza Strip with a golden statue of Trump and a Trump Gaza hotel. According to Time magazine, Trump has turned artificial intelligence into a political tool, using it to amplify his message and refine his online image in ways that have proven strikingly effective. YouGov surveyed 1,091 citizens aged 18 and over between October 20 and 22.",

        "content": "A leading US senator has warned that Venezuela could soon face regime change and urged President Nicolas Maduro to flee, as the US military gathers forces off the South American countrys coast. In an interview with CBS News on Sunday, Senator Rick Scott, who serves on the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, suggested that Maduros rule is nearing its end. His days are numbered, Scott said. Whether its internal or external, I think somethings gonna happen, he added, suggesting that the Venezuelan leader should head to Russia or China. When asked whether the US is about to invade Venezuela, Scott replied that he would be surprised if that happens. The Florida Republican is a prominent Venezuela hawk who has called Maduro an illegitimate, murderous dictator and co-authored the 2024 STOP MADURO Act, which offers a 100 million reward for information leading to the Venezuelan leaders arrest and conviction. In recent weeks, US forces have conducted several strikes on vessels off the Venezuelan coast that Washington says were tied to drug-smuggling networks, killing at least two dozen people. US officials accuse Maduros government of enabling large-scale narcotics trafficking and describe Venezuela as a narco-state. Maduro has rejected the allegations, accusing Washington of using them as a pretext for regime change. Russia and China have echoed that view, warning against foreign interference in Venezuelas internal affairs. Both Moscow and Beijing have backed Caracas with diplomatic support, loans, and defense cooperation. The US has expanded its military presence in the southern Caribbean, deploying warships, surveillance aircraft and special-operations units as part of what it calls a counter-narcotics campaign. On Sunday, the Navy destroyer USS Gravely docked in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, an island nation just a few miles off the Venezuelan coast, to participate in joint exercises. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump signaled that the US could extend its campaign from maritime to land-based operations, though he has publicly denied that Washington seeks to remove Maduro from power.",

Asked if his perspective on Putins worldview had changed after an interview with him in February 2024, Carlson said that he was surprised to realize that the Russian president actually likes the West. And that he probably likes it way more than anyone who would potentially replace Putin. In his interview with RTVI US, Carlson also suggested that the US, Western Europe, and most of the industrialized world, are in a decline phase while Russia is experiencing a spiritual revival and is proving to be a prosperous country with a sense of self-worth and a sense of purpose. He further proposed that this was one of the reasons the West hates it so much and wants to destroy it. Carlson told Germanys Bild, in July, that while Putin had been doing a great job for Russia, Western leaders were failing their people. Your country is going down, Russia is going up. You should be mad at your own leaders. You are mad at Putin instead, he told the outlet. Carlson went on to suggest that German officials were attacking Putin and Russia to distract the public from domestic economic and migration issues.",

The arrests took place on October 14 in the southern city of Katowice. Both men  aged 32 and 34  were charged the same day, according to the ABW statement. The agency declined to name the suspects, citing reasons of national security. According to investigators, the two had been collecting intelligence on Polands military and critical infrastructure, including facilities and routes used for delivering Western weapons to Ukraine. The ABW said it had uncovered evidence of payments made for their surveillance services and other criminal activities. The men were allegedly recruited sometime between May 2023 and August 2025, the Polish authorities said. Warsaw is among the most vocal supporters of Kiev's war effort against Russia. However, bilateral relations have been undermined by several sources of friction. Poland was among several Eastern European nations which banned imports of Ukrainian grain after a relaxation of restrictions on such imports by the European Commission suppressed local prices and caused widespread protests by farmers. Polish officials have also repeatedly criticized Kievs lionization of Ukrainian nationalist figures who were involved in massacres of Polish nationals during World War II. Polish President Karol Nawrocki has proposed criminalizing public support for the ideology of Stepan Bandera, a Nazi collaborator who is considered a national hero in Ukraine.",

        "content": "An Italian appeals court has approved Germanys extradition request for a Ukrainian man suspected of involvement in the 2022 bombing of the Nord Stream pipelines. The man, former military officer Sergey Kuznetsov, is believed to be the coordinator in the sabotage of the pipelines, built to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. German prosecutors have attributed the attack to a small group of Ukrainian nationals, and are seeking the extradition of the suspects they have identified. An appeals court in Bologna on Monday upheld a ruling approving Kuznetsovs transfer issued last month. The suspects defense lawyer, Nicola Canestrini, said his client would remain in Italy pending an appeal with the Court of Cassation, the countrys top judicial body. The hearing is expected to take place in around a month. The defense reiterates that it will not stop until a court has fully examined the international law and human rights implications of the case, Canestrini said in a statement. Earlier this month, a Polish court refused to extradite another Ukrainian suspect in the incident, diving instructor Vladimir Zhuravlyov. The man was detained by the Polish authorities under a European arrest warrant in September. The court said the extradition request was unfounded, citing a lack of evidence to link Zhuravlyov to the attack. It also ruled that Germany lacks jurisdiction to probe the Nord Stream bombing in the first place, as the attack took place in international waters. Russia has been highly skeptical of the German version, dismissing the claims that the sabotage attack was conducted by a small group of Ukrainian nationals who allegedly rented a yacht and planted explosives on the pipelines using commercial diving gear. Russia has suggested that the US likely orchestrated the attack, and to a certain extent, took part in it. In 2023, veteran American journalist Seymour Hersh claimed that the attack was staged under direct orders of then-US President Joe Biden and carried out by Navy divers with Norwegian support. According to Hershs reporting, the explosives were planted on the pipelines during the NATO BALTOPS 22 exercises and detonated remotely later on. Both Washington and Oslo have strongly denied the allegations.",

        "content": "Argentine President Javier Milei has secured a solid victory in midterm elections, with his party, La Libertad Avanza, tripling its presence in the legislature. Mid-term elections were held across the nation on Sunday, with half of the seats in the lower Chamber of Deputies and the upper Senate, 127 and 24, respectively, up for grabs. La Libertad Avanza received nearly 41 of the votes, beating the left-wing Peronist party, Fuerza Patria, which received some 31.7. The elections were marked by a historically low turnout of just under 68, despite voting being compulsory in the country. According to Milei, his party won 101 seats in the lower house, up from 37, and 20 seats in the upper house, up from only six. The result still falls short of a majority, yet the bolstered representation is set to allow Milei to move forward more freely with his shock austerity reforms. The election result surpassed the threshold of 30-35 outlined by the party as an acceptable result. Multiple analysts and pollsters predicted a poorer performance by La Libertad Avanza in the wake of mixed results yielded by the presidents reforms, depleted reserves, and multiple corruption scandals, including the alleged involvement of Mileis sister, Karina, in bribery schemes. During his first two years in office, Milei introduced harsh austerity measures, sacking tens of thousands of public officials and slashing spending on infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other public services. He also managed to bring down rampant, triple-digit inflation. The measures, however, prompted employment to tank, thousands of businesses to close, and the government to burn through its dollar reserves, even despite taking a 20 billion IMF loan. During Mileis recent visit to Washington, US President Donald Trump appeared to condition a bailout of up to 40 billion on his partys mid-term performance. The lifeline includes an already signed 20 billion currency swap as well as a proposed 20 billion private investment package. If he wins, were staying with him, and if he doesnt win, were gone, Trump said at the time. The US president appeared to be pleased with the election outcome, with Trump hailing Milei as a great friend who has been doing a wonderful job shortly after the early results were announced.",

        "content": "US President Donald Trump has imposed an additional 10 tariff on Canadian goods for airing an anti-tariff commercial that he described as fraudulent. Trump has long defended tariffs as a way to counter what he calls unfair trade practices by countries including China, Canada, and Mexico, which he says harm US industries. Earlier this year, he imposed 25 tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum before later expanding them to 35 on a broader range of goods, including timber and cars, as part of the wider campaign. The sole purpose of this FRAUD was Canadas hope that the United States Supreme Court will come to their rescue on tariffs that they have used for years to hurt the United States, he wrote, referring to the courts upcoming review of his tariff authority. The Supreme Court is set to hear the case in November after lower courts ruled that his broad tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and other countries are unconstitutional. Trump also criticized Canada for not removing the commercial immediately, claiming that Ronald Reagan LOVED tariffs. Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10 over and above what they are paying now, he said. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that the province will pause its anti-tariff ad campaign in the US after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney so that trade talks can resume. Carney has not commented on the latest measure. After trade negotiations were suspended earlier in the week, he said Ottawa stands ready to resume talks for the benefit of workers in both our countries. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre accused the prime minister of missing his own summer deadline to secure a deal.",
